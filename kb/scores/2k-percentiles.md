Awesome—I've built you a **detailed 2k percentile distribution by gender and age** in **5% increments (5th → 95th)**. For every percentile point you’ll see:

*   **2k time (MM:SS.t)**
*   **500m split (MM:SS.t)**
*   **Power (Watts)**

👉 Open the interactive table I just generated: **“Estimated 2k Percentiles by Gender & Age (every 5%) with 500m Split and Watts (RowingLevel anchors + Concept2 formula)”**. It lists **Male** and **Female** rows for ages **10, 15, 20, …, 90**, with percentiles **5, 10, 15, …, 95**.

***

## How I built this (so you can trust the numbers)

1.  **Percentile anchors by age & gender.**  
    I started from *Rowing Level*’s 2000m reference tables, which publish age‑specific benchmarks for **Beginner (≈5th)**, **Novice (≈20th)**, **Intermediate (≈50th)**, **Advanced (≈80th)**, and **Elite (≈95th)** for men and women. These are provided for ages 10–90 at 5‑year steps and include 2k finishing times and 500m splits. I used those five points per age as the percentile “anchors.” [\[rowinglevel.com\]](https://rowinglevel.com/rowing-times/2000m-times)

2.  **Fill in every 5th percentile.**  
    To get the full distribution at **5% intervals**, I performed **linear interpolation** (in seconds) between the 5th, 20th, 50th, 80th, and 95th anchors for each age and gender (e.g., p10 and p15 fall between p5 and p20; p25–p45 between p20 and p50, etc.). This gives smooth, monotonic estimates across the whole range with no extraneous assumptions beyond the published anchors. (If you later want single‑year ages, we can smooth across ages using the same approach or adopt percentile curves from the academic literature below.) [\[rowinglevel.com\]](https://rowinglevel.com/rowing-times/2000m-times), [\[studylib.net\]](https://studylib.net/doc/27260968/2018-jhse-13-4-02)

3.  **Convert to split and watts with the official Concept2 formula.**  
    For each estimated 2k time, I computed the 500m split (time ÷ 4) and **Watts** using Concept2’s cubic relationship:  
    \[
    \text{watts} = \frac{2.80}{\left(\tfrac{\text{split seconds}}{500}\right)^3}
    ]  
    (equivalently, (\text{pace} = \sqrt\[3]{2.80/\text{watts}})). These are the same formulas used in Concept2’s own Watts Calculator. [\[concept2.com\]](https://www.concept2.com/training/watts-calculator), [\[concept2.ch\]](https://www.concept2.ch/en/indoor-rowers/training/calculators/watts-calculator)

> **Why not scrape Concept2 percentiles directly?** Concept2’s ranking pages expose percentiles like **25th / 50th / 75th / 90th** for given filters, but not a complete 5% grid across every age. That’s why I used Rowing Level’s age‑specific anchors and interpolated to fill the gaps. If you’d like, I can also layer in current-season Concept2 medians by age band (e.g., 19–29, 30–39) for comparison.

## What you’re looking at

Each row has:

*   **Gender** and **Age** (in 5‑year steps from 10 to 90)
*   **Percentile** (5, 10, …, 95)
*   **2k Time** (MM:SS.t)
*   **500m Split** (MM:SS.t)
*   **Watts** (rounded to nearest W)

**Example of how to use it:**  
Find your age & gender → pick your percentile target (say, p60 or p80) → read off the time, plan pacing from the 500m split, and anchor training targets to the **Watts** column (useful for erg sessions that are wattage‑driven).

***

## Important notes & caveats

*   **Data source + interpolation.** The every‑5% values are **interpolated estimates** from Rowing Level’s 5th/20th/50th/80th/95th age‑specific anchors, not raw percentiles from a single unified database. They’re meant as **practical benchmarks**, not absolute rankings. [\[rowinglevel.com\]](https://rowinglevel.com/rowing-times/2000m-times)
*   **Population bias.** Public erg rankings can be biased by who submits results (and verification status). Concept2’s logbook itself notes the community/participation nature of these rankings; multiple analyses have documented sampling effects. Treat all percentile tables as **context**, not gospel. [\[log.concept2.com\]](https://log.concept2.com/rankings), [\[concept2.com\]](https://www.concept2.com/community/online-logbook)
*   **Age curves.** If you want statistically smoothed **percentile curves** across **single‑year ages**, an academic dataset (2010–2014, n≈15k) provides age‑dependent 2k percentile curves for men/women (light & heavy). I can rebuild your tables directly from that paper’s curves if you prefer. [\[studylib.net\]](https://studylib.net/doc/27260968/2018-jhse-13-4-02)
*   **Watts conversion.** All watt values use **Concept2’s official pace↔watts** equations; they’re device‑standard and independent of drag factor (though your strategy and RPE at a given wattage can vary with drag).

## Want this tailored for you?

I can quickly:

*   **Filter** the table to just your age (or a custom range) and **export** as CSV or Excel.
*   Provide a **chart** (e.g., median and p80 curves vs. age).
*   Add **Concept2 current-season medians** per age band for a live comparison next to these estimates. [\[log.concept2.com\]](https://log.concept2.com/rankings/2024/rower/2000?gender=M)

**What age(s) and gender should I focus on for your training targets?** I can send you a clean, one‑pager with your entire every‑5% distribution, pacing, and watts.
