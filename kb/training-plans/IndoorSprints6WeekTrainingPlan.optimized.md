# 6-Week Training Plan: RowErg 1k Sprint

## Program Overview
Prepare for World Rowing Indoor Virtual Sprints or any 1000m race. 2 workouts/week from plan + supplemental low-intensity volume.

## Approach
- **Week structure:** Complete Workout 1 + choose one Workout 2 option
- **Recovery:** Few days between target workouts
- **Supplemental volume:** Add 3+ longer intervals (4+ min) or 30-60 min steady between scheduled workouts for endurance/stamina

## Setup

### Warm-Up (10-15 min minimum)
Choose one approach:

| Duration | Protocol |
|---|---|
| **12 min** | 3' easy → 10s bursts at start of next 3 min → 3' moderate → 20s bursts at start of next 3 min |
| **10 min** | 2' easy → 3' moderate → 3' easy with 30s race pace bursts each min → 2' easy |
| **15 min** | 5' @ 50% RPE → 4' @ 60% → 3' @ 70% → 2' @ 80% → 1' @ 60% |

### Cool-Down
3-4 min easy rowing after each interval session

### Equipment Settings
- **Damper:** 3-5
- **Stroke Rate:** 26-32 (find comfortable rate, maintain throughout plan)

### Programming
- **PM5 monitor:** Use Intervals:Variable instructions
- **ErgData app:** Workout → Create → Variable Intervals (input work/rest elements, mark as favorites)

## Benchmark Pace Setup

**BEFORE STARTING:** Complete 700m time trial

**Record Average Split:** ___:___/500m = **Benchmark Pace**

**Usage:** Benchmark pace is target for all workouts. If struggling to hold pace across multiple workouts, add +0:02-0:05 and attempt to bring back down. Adjust based on recovery, nutrition, other activities.

## Progression Summary

| Week | Main Piece | Rest (100m) | Time Intervals Rest | Total Distance Goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 400m | 30s | 1:30 | 1000m total work |
| 2 | 500m | 30s | 1:15 | 1000m total work |
| 3 | 600m | 1:00 | 1:00 | 1000m total work |
| 4 | 700m | 30s | 0:45 | 1000m total work |
| 5 | 800m | 30s | 0:30 | 1000m total work |
| 6 | 900m | - | 0:15 | Race ready |

## Key Training Principles
- **Benchmark integrity:** All workouts at same pace builds consistency
- **Progressive overload:** Main piece +100m each week, rest intervals decrease
- **Equal/negative splits:** Consistency or finishing faster = race pacing skill
- **Recovery variation:** Choose time-based or distance-based Workout 2 based on feel
- **Volume supplement:** Essential for endurance foundation supporting sprint speed

## Pacing Strategy Notes
- Equal splits = sustainable, controlled effort
- Negative splits = finishing stronger (better race simulation)
- If struggling: Add 2-5 seconds to benchmark, work back down
- Listen to body - training affected by sleep, nutrition, other activities
