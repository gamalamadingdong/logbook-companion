## Training by Population

| Group | Weekly Volume | Intensity Focus | Key Adjustments |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Junior (U18)** | 40-80 km, 5 days | 85-90% UT2/UT1, minimal anaerobic | Skill development, technique drills, bodyweight strength. Rapid recovery but growth considerations. |
| **Collegiate** | 80-150 km, 8-14 sessions | Frequent 2k tests, high volume base | 20 hr/week NCAA limit. 2-a-days common. Training camps boost volume. Spring = 2k focus. |
| **Masters (40+)** | 30-80 km, 3-5 days | Slightly higher moderate (careful management) | Quality over quantity. Longer warm-ups. Recovery paramount. Hard/easy pattern. Lower stroke rate for safety. |
| **Para-Rowers** | Individualized, often lower | High-intensity in shorter bursts | PR1 (arms-only): more frequent short sessions. Vital S&C for imbalances. Flexible for medical needs. |

## Training Principles & Science

### Why Low Intensity Dominates (80-95%)
**Physiological Adaptations:**
- ↑ Mitochondrial density
- ↑ Capillarization
- ↑ Fat oxidation → glycogen sparing
- ↑ Stroke volume (over time)
- Low recovery cost → high daily volume possible

### Why Include High Intensity (5-20%)
**Central Adaptations:**
- ↑ VO₂max (cardiac stroke volume)
- ↑ Lactate buffering capacity
- ↑ Fast-twitch fiber recruitment
- Race-specific power production

**Evidence:** 
- Study comparing polarized vs pyramidal (11 weeks): no significant difference in 2k performance when both had 90%+ LIT
- Threshold-heavy programs: "Mixed training produces mixed results" - frequent stagnation/overtraining
- Optimal HIT: 15-20 min total work @ VO₂max intensity per session

### Zone Determination Methods

| Method | How It Works | Application |
|---|---|---|
| **2k Pace** | Current 2k PB as reference | Pete Plan: 15k @ 2k+15", intervals @ 2k pace. Wolverine: splits based on 2k erg. |
| **Lactate Testing** | Step test → find LT1 (2 mmol) & LT2 (4 mmol) | Defines UT1 and AT paces. Example: 2 mmol @ 2:10, 4 mmol @ 1:50. |
| **Heart Rate** | %HRmax or %HR reserve | UT2: 65-75% HRmax, UT1: 75-85%, AT: 85-90%, Max: >90% |
| **RPE/Talk Test** | Subjective effort | UT2: conversational. Threshold: broken speech. Max: can't talk. |
| **Performance Tests** | 6k, 30 min, 10k trials | 6k → threshold power. 30'@r20 → aerobic capacity (GB standard). |

## Workout Types & Purpose

### 1. Steady-State Endurance (UT2/UT1)
**Intensity:** UT2 = 65-75% HRmax (conversational), UT1 = 75-85% HRmax (moderate)
**Duration:** 30-120 min continuous or broken
**Purpose:** Aerobic base development, technique refinement
**Examples:**
- 3×20' UT2, 2' rest
- 60' continuous UT1
- Pete Plan: 15k @ 2k+15" (firm steady)
- Wolverine L3: 60+ min moderate intensity
**Frequency:** Daily for elites, 3-5×/week for club rowers

### 2. Threshold/Lactate Transport (AT/UT0)
**Intensity:** 85-90% HRmax, 4-6 mmol lactate
**Duration:** 20-40 min total (continuous or broken)
**Purpose:** Raise lactate threshold, improve lactate clearance
**Examples:**
- 2×20' @ AT, 4' rest
- 3×2000m @ head race pace, 3' rest
- 30' @ r20-22, max sustainable effort
- Wolverine L2: 4×1500m, 5×1500m @ 5k pace
**Frequency:** 1× per week or every 2 weeks

### 3. VO₂max Intervals (HIT)
**Intensity:** 95-100% VO₂max power, HR near max
**Duration:** 2-6 min intervals, ~1:1 work:rest
**Purpose:** ↑ VO₂max, cardiac stroke volume, anaerobic capacity
**Examples:**
- 4×4', 4' rest @ hard pace (classic)
- 8×500m, 3:30 rest @ 2k pace or faster (Pete Plan)
- 4×1k, 5' rest @ 2k pace (Wolverine L1)
- 6×500m, 2:30 rest
**Target:** 15-20 min total work @ VO₂max per session
**Frequency:** 1× per week or every 1-2 weeks (pre-competition)

### 4. Anaerobic/Sprint Intervals
**Intensity:** Maximal, >10 mmol lactate
**Duration:** 10s - 1 min bursts
**Purpose:** Peak power, anaerobic capacity, lactate tolerance, race starts
**Examples:**
- 6-10× 1' max, 3' rest
- 30"/30" (sprint/easy) × 10-20 reps
- Practice starts: 6 high strokes, 20s paddle, repeat
- Pete Plan: 250/500/750/1000/750/500/250 pyramid
**Frequency:** Sparingly (high recovery cost)

### 5. Race-Pace Pieces
**Intensity:** Race-specific
**Duration:** Varies (500m-2k segments)
**Purpose:** Strategy, pacing, race psychology, confidence
**Examples:**
- 3×(4'+3'+2'+1') @ decreasing rates
- 1250m pieces @ race rate
- Side-by-side seat racing (1500-2000m)
- Simulated 2k with start/body/sprint segments
**Frequency:** 1× per week or biweekly in final month

### 6. Recovery Rows
**Intensity:** Very light, 60-65% HRmax (UT3)
**Duration:** 20-40 min
**Purpose:** Active recovery, blood flow, metabolic clearance
**Examples:**
- 40' erg very light, HR <130, technique drills
- 30' easy spin or paddle (post-hard workout flush)
- 10' paddle between hard pieces
**Critical:** Must be truly easy, not "medium"

## Testing & Progress Tracking

### Standard Tests

| Test | Duration | Purpose | Frequency | Target Metrics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2k Erg** | ~6-8 min | Sprint race fitness, selection | 3-6×/year | Time improvement, power profile |
| **6k Erg** | 18-24 min | Aerobic capacity, endurance | 2-3×/year | Sustained power, threshold |
| **30' @ r20** | 30 min | Aerobic base (GB standard) | Monthly/bimonthly | Distance (e.g., 8000m → 8200m) |
| **Lactate Step** | 5× 4min stages | LT1/LT2 thresholds | 2-3×/year | Curve shift right = improved efficiency |
| **On-Water Trial** | 2k-5k | Boat speed, race conditions | As needed | Time improvement, speed consistency |

### Progress Indicators
**Positive Adaptation:**
- Resting HR stable or slightly lower
- Same pace = lower HR over time
- Test improvements
- Energy in hard sessions
- Consistent splits in workouts

**Overtraining Signs:**
- Persistent fatigue
- Elevated morning HR
- Can't hit target splits
- Prolonged muscle soreness
- Poor sleep, irritability
- Easy pace drifts upward in HR

### Training Adjustments from Data
- **2k lacking speed in final 500m** → More lactate tolerance work, better pacing
- **Great 6k, poor 2k** → Add sprint work, weights (boost anaerobic power)
- **Stagnation** → Check for overtraining or need stimulus change
- **Threshold improved** → Update training zone paces
- **Volume plateau** → Focus on strength or technique (diminishing returns from more volume)

## Deload & Taper Strategies

### Deload Week (Every 3-6 Weeks)
**Volume Reduction:** 40-50% (e.g., 100 km → 60 km)
**Intensity:** Keep some, but reduced frequency (drop 1 interval session)
**Focus:** Low-intensity technique, recovery
**Result:** Post-deload performance jump indicates successful adaptation

### Race Taper (5-10 Days)
**Volume Reduction:** 40-60% of peak
**Intensity:** Maintain with race-specific efforts (e.g., 1k @ race pace)
**Rest:** More rest days (2 in final week vs. usual 1)
**Distribution:** Polarized naturally - ditch moderate, keep easy + race pace
**Goal:** Low fatigue, high sharpness ("itching to go")

## Special Considerations

### On-Water vs Ergometer Balance
- **Erg advantages:** Quantifiable, weather-independent, reliable for intervals
- **Water advantages:** Technical development, boat-specific, team cohesion
- **Typical mix:** Erg for HIT sessions, water for endurance/technique
- **Specificity:** Match training to goal (2k erg race vs. boat race)
- **Winter:** More erg (weather). Spring: shift to water (race prep)

### Concurrent Training (Strength + Endurance)
- **Challenge:** High endurance volume can interfere with strength gains
- **Solution:** Periodize strength - max strength in winter, maintain during racing
- **Frequency:** 2-4 sessions/week for strength improvement
- **Timing:** Heavy squats after rowing or on light rowing days
- **Limited time:** Focus on robustness/injury prevention vs. max strength

### High-Volume Risks (150+ km/week)
- Overuse injuries: rib stress fractures, lumbar strain, tendinitis
- **Mitigation:** Monitor technique under fatigue, vary boat types (scull/sweep), cross-training (reduce repetitive strain)
- **Recovery strategies:** Massage, sleep (8-10 hrs), nutrition, HRV monitoring

### Injury Comeback Protocol
**Rule of thumb:** Start @ 50% previous volume, build 10-15%/week
**Example progression:**
- Week 1: 3×10' very light
- Week 2: 3×20' UT2
- Week 3: 45-60' steady + 1 light interval session
**Monitor:** Pain-free at each stage before progressing
**Adjust expectations:** Fitness lost during time off - plan mini rebuild

### Limited Training Time (3-4 days/week)
**Strategy:** Higher proportion of moderate/hard (but careful)
**Sample week (4 days):**
- Mon: Hard intervals
- Wed: Threshold or fartlek
- Fri: Recovery or cross-training
- Sat: Long row
**Risk:** Going hard every session → burnout
**Solution:** Still include true easy sessions, use micro-sessions (20 min bonus workouts)

## Key Training Principles Summary

1. **80-95% low intensity** builds aerobic base with minimal recovery cost
2. **5-20% high intensity** develops VO₂max, lactate tolerance, race power
3. **Periodization** moves from general → specific → competitive → transition
4. **Testing** provides individualized zones and tracks adaptation
5. **Recovery** is where adaptation occurs - deloads and sleep are training
6. **Specificity** matters - train the energy systems and movements for your goal race
7. **Progressive overload** with adequate recovery avoids plateau/overtraining
8. **Individual variation** requires monitoring and adjusting (HR, splits, RPE, wellness)

| **Long distance/marathon** | 8-12 | 80-150 km | 5-8 | Longer sessions |
| **Weight loss/fitness** | 3-5 | 30-50 km | 4-5 | Calorie focus |

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Train a lot (appropriate volume for level)
- Train smart (right intensity distribution)
- Recover well (sleep, nutrition, deloads)
- Test regularly (validate progress, adjust zones)
- Stay consistent (adherence > perfection)
