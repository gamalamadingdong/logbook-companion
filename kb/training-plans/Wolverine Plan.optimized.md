# The Wolverine Plan
*University of Michigan Women's Rowing Team Training Plan*

## Core Training Principles

### 1. Overload Principle
Elite athletes require:
- More frequent training
- Longer durations
- Greater intensities
Progressive challenge needed to stimulate physiological adaptation.

### 2. Specificity Principle
- Majority of training = actual rowing activity
- Cross-training has limitations (supplements, not replaces)
- Erg training as quantifiable tool (superior to water for measuring performance)
- Training must target 2000m race (under 7 min event)

### 3. Reversibility Principle
- Training gains are NOT permanent
- Any reduction in training = fitness loss
- Continuous effort required year-to-year

### 4. Individual Differences Principle
- Genetic variation = different responses to same program
- Plan allows every athlete to reach personal potential
- Not everyone progresses at same rate

## Training Plan Philosophy

### Year-Round Consistency
- **No seasonal variation** in workout types
- All intensity levels performed throughout year (L1-L4)
- Same proportions maintained (except slightly less race-pace Sept-Oct)
- Continuous race-specific preparation vs. "base building" phases

### Training as Investment
**Metaphor:** NCAA finals as auction
- Training = funds available to bid
- Poor training = limited funds (fade early in race)
- Superior training = \$100 bills in each hand (strong throughout race)
- Accumulate maximum capacity through substantial training volume

### Non-Negotiable Requirements
Training load necessary for National Championship = Law of Nature (like gravity)
- Can't be negotiated or reduced
- Only negotiable element = goal itself
- Decision: How many crews am I satisfied with beating?

### No Magic Formula
- Success = lots of hard work (no secret, anyone can do it)
- Plan organizes and focuses efforts efficiently
- Athletes take ownership of race readiness
- Ultimate success/failure rests on athlete's shoulders

## Wolverine Plan Workout Levels

### Level 4 (L4): Low-Rate Endurance
**Purpose:** Aerobic base, efficiency, high volume with low stress

**Characteristics:**
- Lowest intensity, highest volume
- Low stroke rates (18-22 SPM)
- Prescribed splits based on 2k time
- Emphasis on relaxation and efficiency
- Can be performed daily

**Typical Workouts:**
- 2×40' @ R18/20/22 with specific splits (e.g., 2k+18", 2k+15", 2k+12")
- Long continuous pieces (60-90 min)
- Focus on stroke economy and aerobic adaptation

### Level 3 (L3): Steady-State Moderate
**Purpose:** Aerobic development at moderate intensity

**Characteristics:**
- Moderate intensity, firm steady pace
- 60+ min continuous rowing
- Sustainable but challenging
- Bridges L4 and threshold work

**Typical Workouts:**
- 60-90' continuous @ moderate intensity
- Slightly below threshold
- Develops sustainable cruising speed

### Level 2 (L2): Threshold Intervals
**Purpose:** Lactate threshold training, longer intervals totaling 6-8k

**Characteristics:**
- Intensity: ~5k race pace
- Intervals: 1500m, 2000m pieces
- Total work: 7.5-8k per session
- Moderate lactate accumulation (~4-6 mmol)

**Typical Workouts:**
- 4×1500m @ 5k pace
- 5×1500m @ 5k pace
- 3×2000m @ 5k pace
- Rest: Short (allow lactate accumulation between pieces)

**Frequency:** Once every 2-3 weeks (moderately taxing)

### Level 1 (L1): High-Intensity Intervals
**Purpose:** VO₂max, anaerobic capacity, race pace/faster

**Characteristics:**
- Highest intensity
- Intervals: 500m, 750m, 1000m
- Pace: 2k pace or faster
- Full recovery between reps (1:1 or 1:2 work:rest)

**Typical Workouts:**
- 8×500m @ 2k pace, 3-4' rest
- 4×1k @ 2k pace, 5' rest
- 5×750m @ 2k pace, 3-4' rest

**Key Principle:** "Big proponent of taking adequate recovery to allow appropriate intensity"
- Rest long enough to hit target pace each rep
- Quality over fatigue accumulation

**Frequency:** 
- Once/week during peak training
- 4×1k specifically: Every 3-4 weeks (extremely demanding)

## Training Distribution Philosophy

### Volume Hierarchy
1. **L4 (Highest volume):** Daily or near-daily, multiple hours/week
2. **L3 (Moderate volume):** Several times/week
3. **L2 (Low-moderate volume):** 1-2×/week maximum
4. **L1 (Lowest volume):** 1×/week, specific workouts

### Intensity Balance
- Large aerobic base (L4 + L3)
- Regular threshold work (L2) to raise lactate threshold
- Strategic high-intensity (L1) for race-pace power
- Adequate recovery between hard sessions

### Year-Round Application
- September-October: Slightly less L1
- November-May: All levels in consistent proportions
- No "off-season" or pure base-building phases
- Continuous race-specific preparation

## Race-Pace Training Philosophy

### 15-20 Minutes Total at VO₂max
Classic training theory: ~15-20' total work at VO₂max intensity per session
- 5×4' = 20' total
- 4×1000m ≈ 16' total
- 8×500m ≈ 16' total

### Progressive Specificity
Not gradual transition from "base" to "race pace"
- Race-pace work present throughout year
- Specificity built through cumulative exposure
- Volume at race intensity accumulates over months

## Performance Metrics & Testing

### 2k Erg Test
- Primary performance measure
- Used for seat selection
- Determines training pace calculations (L4 splits based on 2k time)
- Regular testing validates training effectiveness

### Workout-Based Assessment
- Track splits across all workout levels
- Consistency at prescribed paces = adaptation
- Ability to complete workouts = fitness progression
- L4 efficiency improves = aerobic base strengthening

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Systematic Progression
Plan provides structure for gradual overload without overtraining

### 2. Quantification
Erg allows precise measurement of:
- Power output
- Pace consistency
- Training load progression

### 3. Ownership
Athletes control their race readiness through:
- Session completion
- Intensity adherence
- Recovery management

### 4. Consistency
Year-round training in all intensity zones maintains:
- Aerobic fitness
- Threshold power
- Race-pace capacity
- Technical efficiency

### 5. Recovery Integration
Adequate recovery allows:
- L4 work daily (low stress)
- L1 work weekly (high stress, adequate rest)
- L2 work biweekly (moderate stress)

## Metaphors for Training Mindset

### Training as War Preparation
"When we race we are going to war"
- Training = bigger guns + more ammo
- Superior training = superior firepower on race day

### Supreme Effort Requires Small Efforts
Championship Final = Supreme Effort
- Requires countless small efforts throughout season
- Little-appreciated but essential requirements
- Accumulation of daily training = Championship capacity

## Training Philosophy Summary

**No magic, no gimmicks - just organized hard work**
- Plan helps focus efforts efficiently
- Success ultimately rests on athlete's shoulders
- Blessing or curse: You control your readiness
- Training Plan = way to take ownership of performance

**Annual consistency over periodized phases**
- All workout types year-round
- Race-specific preparation always
- No extended "base" or "conditioning" phases
- Continuous systematic progression

**Evidence-based intensity distribution**
- Large volume low-intensity (L4)
- Moderate threshold work (L2)
- Strategic high-intensity (L1)
- All essential for 2000m performance

## Plan Requirements

### Training Load
Amount of work necessary for National Championship competition:
- High frequency (daily or near-daily)
- High volume (hours/day)
- High intensity (regular L1/L2 sessions)
- Year-round commitment (Sept-May)

### Athlete Commitment
- Prioritize training schedule
- Execute prescribed workouts with focus
- Recovery and nutrition management
- Accept that goal determines required effort
- Training = non-negotiable investment in racing

### Measurement & Adjustment
- Regular 2k testing
- Track workout performance
- Monitor adaptation
- Adjust paces as fitness improves
- Quantify progress objectively

## Wolverine Plan Origins
Developed and refined by Mike Caviston for University of Michigan Women's Rowing Team through systematic testing and performance tracking. Plan represents distillation of exercise physiology principles applied specifically to 2000m rowing performance.
