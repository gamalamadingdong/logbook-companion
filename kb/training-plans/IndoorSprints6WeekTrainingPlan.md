# **6-WEEK TRAINING PLAN RowErg 1k**

#### **How to Approach**

Use this 6-week training plan to prepare for the World Rowing Indoor Virtual Sprints or any 1000-meter race. Aim to complete two workouts per week from this plan. Each week, complete Workout 1 and then choose between two additional workout options to use as your Workout 2. Feel free to switch things up when choosing your second workout or stick to the same style each week. Give yourself a few days to recover between the two target driven workouts.

Add volume to your training plan by including longer, lower intensity workouts in-between your scheduled training workouts. Try out a few (three or more) longer (four or more minutes) intervals, or even a steady effort for 30 minutes up to an hour. Time spent rowing is valuable to your endurance and stamina.

#### **Warm Up**

Warm up for at least 10 minutes before every workout. Longer warm-ups will help you with these shorter, higher intensity training workouts. Here are a few suggestions for your warm-up:

- 12 minute warm-up: Row easy for 3 minutes, then take 10 second bursts at the beginning of each of the next three minutes, then back to moderate rowing for 3 minutes, then take 20 second bursts at the beginning of each of the next three minutes.
- 10 minute warm-up: 2 minutes easy, 3 minutes moderate, 3 minutes easy with 30 second bursts to race pace every minute, 2 minutes easy.
- 15 minute warm-up: Row easy at 50% effort (5 on Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale) for 5 minutes, then at 60% effort (6 on RPE Scale) for 4 minutes, at 70% effort (7 on RPE Scale) for 3 minutes, at 80% effort (8 on RPE Scale) for 2 minutes, and back down to 60% for 1 minute.

# **Cool Down**

After each interval workout session, take 3-4 minutes to row easily and cool yourself down.

#### **Stroke Rate and Damper Setting**

Find a stroke rate and damper setting that you feel comfortable sticking with for the entire training plan. We suggest a damper setting between 3-5 and a stroke rate of 26-32.

# **Programming Workouts**

Workouts can be programmed directly into the Performance Monitor. Use the [Intervals:Variable](https://www.concept2.com/service/monitors/pm5/how-to-use/setting-variable-interval-workout) programming instructions found here.

Workouts can also easily be programmed in ErgData, our free app for iOS and Android devices. Select **Workout** from the ribbon at the bottom of the ErgData app, and **Create > Variable Intervals**. You can then input the work and rest elements for each workout as specified in each workout below. Mark these workouts as your favorites so they are easy to access each week. Modifications can be made as you progress through the training plan.

## **Benchmark Pace**

This plan uses a benchmark pace, which will be determined by a preliminary time trial (700m). The average pace (time/500m) from your time trial will be considered your benchmark pace. This benchmark pace is used to create the workouts each week. If you're having trouble holding the suggested pace over multiple workouts, just let your pace adjust accordingly. Try adding +0:02-0:05 to start out, and then see if you can bring the pace back down. Training can be affected by things like other activities, rest, recovery and nutrition, so listen to your body as you follow this plan.
