# Advanced 2k Training Plan (8 Weeks)

## Target Audience
High fitness level (train 4+×/week regularly). Maximize 2000m performance as indoor rowing focus or gym supplement.

## Training Guidelines

| Element | Details |
|---|---|
| **Warm-up** | 5-10 min on other equipment + dynamic stretching |
| **Cool-down** | 3 min light rowing + static stretch (glutes, hamstrings, quads) |
| **Technique** | Drive: LEGS flat → BODY lean back → ARMS pull. Recovery: ARMS → BODY → LEGS. |
| **Split** | Time to row 500m. Lower split = harder work. Keep consistent. Display: 0:00/500m. |
| **Damper** | Set to ≤4 for good technique maintenance |
| **SPM (Strokes/Min)** | ↑ Rate = ↓ Split (rowing faster). Lower rate = sustainable longer. Increase rate by driving harder with legs while taking time on recovery. |
| **Cross Training** | Other cardio equipment to supplement training, build endurance with variety |

## Supplemental Training (Weekly)
- **Strength:** Squats, lunges
- **Core:** Plank, side plank, dorsal raises (lower back focus)
- **Flexibility:** Hip flexors, calves

## Phase 1: Weeks 1-4 (High-Rate Endurance)

**Monthly Goal:** Work harder for longer while maintaining technique. Progress to increasingly higher stroke rates.

**Session 3 (all weeks):** Cross-training 15-20 min on any cardio equipment

### Week 1
- **Session 1:** 4' @ 20, 3' @ 22, 2' @ 24
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3, 3 min rest, (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3
  - *Goal:* Consistency in split and SPM

### Week 2
- **Session 1:** 4' @ 20, 3' @ 22, 2' @ 24, 1' @ 26
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3, 2 min rest, (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3

### Week 3
- **Session 1:** 5' @ 20, 4' @ 22, 3' @ 24, 2' @ 26
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3, 3 min rest, (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 4

### Week 4
- **Session 1:** 4' @ 22, 3' @ 24, 2' @ 26, 1' @ 28
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3, 2 min rest, (30s row, 1 min rest) × 4

## Phase 2: Weeks 5-8 (Race Preparation)

**Monthly Goal:** Build endurance focused on 2000m goal. Test fitness at target distances.

**Session 3 (all weeks):** Cross-training 20 min on any cardio equipment

### Week 5
- **Session 1:** 3' @ 20, 3' @ 22, 3' @ 24, 2' @ 26, 1' @ 28
- **Session 2:** 1000m row, 3 min rest, 1000m row
  - *Pacing:* Slightly higher split Set 1 to maintain in Set 2 (consistency goal)

### Week 6
- **Session 1:** 4' @ 20, 3' @ 22, 3' @ 24, 2' @ 26, 1' @ 28
- **Session 2:** (1 min @ 26-28, 1 min rest) × 3, 3 min rest, (30s @ 28+, 1 min rest) × 4

### Week 7
- **Session 1:** 5' @ 20, 4' @ 22, 3' @ 24, 2' @ 26, 1' @ 28
- **Session 2:** 1000m @ 26-28, 2.5 min rest, 1000m @ 26-28

### Week 8: Final 2k Test
- **Session 1:** 2000m row
  - *Pacing Strategy:* Hold split slightly higher than Week 7 1000m for first 1000m to achieve consistency in final 1000m

## Progression Patterns
- **Duration:** 9 min → 14 min → 15 min total work (Sessions 1)
- **Rate range:** 20-24 → 20-28 SPM
- **Rest reduction:** 3 min → 2 min → 2.5 min between 1000m pieces
- **Intensity:** 1 min pieces → 30s sprints → 1000m sustained → 2000m race
- **Session 2 evolution:** Equal intervals → mixed durations → distance-based

## Key Differences from Intermediate
- Longer continuous pieces (5 min vs 3 min max)
- Higher stroke rates (up to 28+ SPM)
- More volume per session (14+ min total work)
- Introduction of sprint work (30s pieces)
- 3 sessions/week (including cross-training)

## Success Metrics
- Maintain technique at 26-28 SPM
- Consistent splits at high rates
- 1000m pacing translates to 2k strategy
- Cross-training supports high volume
- Ready for competitive rowing training
