# BEGINNER TRAINING PLAN

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

If you are new to indoor rowing or regular exercise, this eight week plan is for you. It can be used as a standalone training plan, but also works well as part of a longer gym workout, or alongside other fitness activities. At the end of the programme you will be able to confidently row for 2000m.

| Rowing technique                   | It is easy to learn the basics of rowing technique and improve over time.<br>Check out the technique guidance on our website to get started.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |  |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|
| Stay motivated                     | Sometimes it helps to have a goal to work towards. So why not enter an indoor rowing event,<br>or set up your own with friends or other gym goers. Alternatively, plan a charity challenge.                                                                                                                                                            |  |  |
| Get set up                         | Make sure the monitor is at eye level and the foot strap is across the ball of your foot. If using a<br>Concept 2 rowing machine, set the damper level to four or below to help maintain good technique.                                                                                                                                               |  |  |
| Warm up and cool down              | Before every session do 5 minutes of exercise to get your body warmed up.<br>Afterwards, do a 5 minute cool down and then stretch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |  |
| What is 'stroke rate'?             | The number of strokes per minute – with a typical range being 18 to 30. We recommend you stick to a lower stroke<br>rate of 18-24 whilst still perfecting your technique and focus on consistency rather than speed.                                                                                                                                   |  |  |
| What is 'split'?                   | The time it takes to row 500m. Focus on keeping the split, or pace, consistent, which will become easier<br>as your technique and fitness improves.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |  |
| Things to remember<br>when rowing… | Focus on the stroke sequence: legs, body, arms in the drive phase (when you push back and straighten<br>your legs) and arms, body, legs in the recovery phase (when you bend your knees and slide forward).<br>Count to two on the drive and three on the recovery to control your technique and differentiate a hard drive from a<br>slower recovery. |  |  |
| How hard should I row?             | The training programme will ask you to row at a low, medium or high intensity:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |  |
|                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |  |  |

- Working harder, heart rate up
- Can speak in shorter sentences
- Guide rate 22-26
- Not sustainable for long periods

#### High Intensity

- Breathing hard
- Guide rate 26+
- Use for short efforts / bursts

# BEGINNER TRAINING PLAN

### Week 1

Aim: Get used to being on the rowing machine, develop technique (consistent stroke rate, sequence and posture) and build basic fitness.

Session 1: 1 min row at low intensity, 1 min rest, repeat 5 times.

Session 2: 5 min row at low intensity, 3 min rest, repeat 2 times.

Fitness boost: Combine with a 10 min jog / walk – 1 min on, 1 min off.

### Week 2

Aim: Increase the time you exercise and focus on using good technique. Think about rowing smoothly with a focus on the powerful drive, then slow recovery.

Session1: 2 min row at low intensity, I min rest, repeat 5 times.

Session 2: 5 min row at low intensity, 3 min rest (or light row), repeat 3 times.

Fitness boost: Combine with 15 min jog / walk – 1 min on, 1 min off.

#### Week 3

Aim: Further increase exercise time. Work at a higher intensity. Look for consistency in stroke rate and split when rowing for longer durations.

Session 1: 500m at medium intensity, 2 min rest, repeat 4 times. Note time for each 500m.

Session 2: 10 min row with first 5 min at low intensity, next 5 min at medium.

Fitness boost: Combine with 20 min jog / walk – 1 min on, 1 min off.

#### Week 4

Aim: Increase the amount of medium intensity work and change the focus to distance not time i.e. the harder you work, the quicker you finish. Focus on technique control.

Session 1: 1000m row at medium intensity, 5 min rest, repeat 2 times.

Session 2: 15 min row – 3 min low intensity, 3 min medium, 3 min low, 3 min medium, 3 min low.

Fitness boost: Combine with 20 min jog / walk – 2 min on, 1 min off.

#### Week 5

Aim: Feel comfortable with the current level of exercise and complete your first 2000m at medium intensity.

Session 1: 30 strokes at low intensity followed by a 10 stroke burst at medium intensity, repeat 5 times.

Session 2: 2000m row. Note the time.

*To work out an approx. 500m pace to aim for, add together the times for the 4 x 500m session you did (week 3) add 20 seconds and divide by 4. For example:* 

*2.30+2.40+2.40+2.38+20 = 10mins48 secs = 2.42 per 500m.*

Fitness boost: Combine with 20 min jog / walk – 3 min on, 1 min off.

#### Week 6

Aim: Introduce some short pieces at high intensity to help build fitness and ability to recover quickly.

Session 1: 1 min row at high intensity, 1 min rest, repeat 6 times.

Session 2: 500m at medium intensity, 2 min rest, repeat 4 times. Note the times and look for an improvement over week 3 times.

Fitness boost: Combine with 25 min jog / walk – 3 min on, 1 min off.

#### Week 7

Aim: Introduce varied workouts and focus on controlling technique when pushing yourself. Can you maintain good rowing technique when tired?

Session 1: 1000m row at medium intensity (every other minute include a 10 stroke high intensity burst), 5 min rest, repeat 2 times.

Session 2: 10 min row (2 min low intensity, 2 min medium, 1 min high, 2 min medium, 3 min low), 5 min rest, repeat 2 times.

Fitness boost: Combine with 25 min jog / walk – 4 min on, 1 min off.

#### Week 8

Aim: Focus on a powerful drive and slower recovery. How does your 500m compare to week 3 and 6?

Session 1: 5 min row at medium intensity, 3 min rest (or light row), repeat 4 times.

Session 2: 500m row at medium intensity, 1000m at medium, 500m at high, 2 min rest in between.

Fitness boost: Combine with 25 min jog / walk – 4 min on, 1 min off.
