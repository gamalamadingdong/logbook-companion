# INTERMEDIATE TRAINING PLAN

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

This plan is aimed at those with a decent level of fitness, i.e. you regularly train twice a week. It will help you build on your existing fitness, aiming to train up to three times a week on the indoor rowing machine. The plan has been designed to improve your ability to row 2,000m. It is also suitable if you are looking to improve your fitness levels in other sports.

#### **THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN TRAINING…**

| Warm up and cool down         | Always perform a suitable warm up and cool down before and after every session.<br>Example warm up: 5-10 minutes on another piece of equipment followed by some dynamic stretching. Example<br>cool down: 3 minutes light rowing followed by static stretching of main muscles used (glutes, hamstrings, quads).                                                                                                              |

| Rowing technique              | Drive phase: from the start the sequence is LEGS pushed flat, BODY lean back a little, ARMS pull through.<br>Recovery phase: (the reverse of the Drive) ARMS straighten, then BODY leans over, then LEGS bend up to bring<br>you back to the start.<br>For a more detailed look at indoor rowing technique, check out our technique video with double olympic<br>champion Alex Gregory on the British Rowing YouTube channel. |
| What is a split?              | The 'split' is the time it takes to row 500m. The harder you work, the quicker you will row 500m and therefore<br>the lower the split. Aim to be consistent with your splits on all of these workouts. Ensure the display on the<br>monitor shows the split i.e. 0:00/500m.                                                                                                                                                   |
| What is the resistance level? | Set the damper lever to 4 or below. This will help you to maintain good technique for the duration of your<br>workout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| What is the SPM?              | SPM stands for Strokes Per Minute. As the stroke rate increases, the split should naturally drop because you will<br>be rowing faster and working harder.<br>At a slower stroke rate you should be able to maintain your splits for longer.<br>To increase the stroke rate focus on driving/pushing harder with the legs whilst still taking your time on the<br>recovery.                                                    |
| What is cross training?       | Cross training is when you use another piece of cardio equipment to supplement your training routine.<br>The cross training below (Session 3) will help to build your endurance fitness whilst providing variety to your<br>weekly training routine.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Remember to include           | Strength exercises such as squats and lunges.<br>Core exercises that focus on lower back e.g. plank, side plank, dorsal raises.<br>Stretches for your hip flexors and calves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
