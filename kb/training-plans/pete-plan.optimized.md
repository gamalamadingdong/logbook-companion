# Pete Plan Training: Optimized Summary

## Overview
- **Type**: Continuous training plan (3-week cycle, repeated workouts to track progress)
- **Philosophy**: Always faster tomorrow than today; suitable for regular racing/challenges
- **Origin**: Adapted from Wolverine Plan (Mike Caviston) in 2002
- **Structure**: 1 speed interval session + 1 endurance interval session + distance work per week
- **Target**: Balanced training for fast 2k racing (speed, threshold, endurance)

## Three Session Types

### 1. Speed Intervals (4km total, ~2:1 work:rest ratio)
- **Week 1**: 8 × 500m / 3:30 rest
- **Week 2**: 250m, 500m, 750m, 1000m, 750m, 500m, 250m / 1:30 rest per 250m work (pyramid)
- **Week 3**: 4 × 1000m / 5:00 rest

**Target Zones**: 2k pace or faster (TR/AN zones)

### 2. Endurance Intervals (7.5-8km total, ~5 min rest)
- **Week 1**: 5 × 1500m / 5:00 rest
- **Week 2**: 4 × 2000m / 5:00 rest
- **Week 3**: 3k, 2.5k, 2k / 5:00 rest

**Target Zones**: 5k pace to AT zone (~4-5 mmol lactate)

### 3. Distance/Endurance Work
- **Steady Distance**: 8-15km at 22-25 spm, conversational pace (UT2/UT1)
  - Should be ≥10 sec slower than endurance interval pace
  - Done 3× per week (or as much as time permits)
- **Hard Distance**: 5k+ once per week, >25 spm, can be faster than steady (but not flat-out every week)
- **Rest**: 1 full rest day per week (mandatory)

## Weekly Schedule

| Day | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|
| Mon | 8×500m | Pyramid | 4×1000m |
| Tue | Steady | Steady | Steady |
| Wed | 5×1500m | 4×2000m | 3k, 2.5k, 2k |
| Thu | Steady | Steady | Steady |
| Fri | Hard distance | Hard distance | Hard distance |
| Sat | Steady | Steady | Steady |
| Sun | Rest | Rest | Rest |

## Pacing Strategy

**Intervals (Speed & Endurance):**
1. **First attempt**: Estimate pace from nearest distance done (e.g., for 4km speed session, use recent 5k pace)
2. Do all reps except last at that pace
3. Go as fast as possible on final rep
4. Calculate average pace for entire session → new target for next cycle
5. **Next attempt**: All reps except last at new average, go fast on final rep
6. Repeat this progression every 3 weeks

**Steady Distance**: 22-25 spm, recovery pace (≥10 sec slower than endurance intervals), must recover for next hard session

**Interval Rest**: Gentle rowing during rest periods (keep moving, stay hydrated)

## Warm-Up Guidelines
- **Steady Distance**: No warm-up needed
- **Endurance Intervals**: 1-2km steady with water breaks
- **Speed Intervals**: 2-3km with short fast bursts, water breaks

## Adaptation & Modifications

**Time Off Recovery**: Back off 1 sec/pace per week missed (e.g., 2 weeks off = -2 sec target)

**Intensity Management** (for mental difficulty):
- Easy week: -2 sec from previous hard week pace
- Medium week: -1 sec
- Hard week: Normal target
- Rotate through 3-week cycles

**Year-Round**: Not intended for 52 weeks/year; take off-season breaks, adapt intensity for racing schedule

## Benchmark Pacing (Reference Only, NOT First-Attempt Targets)
- 8×500m: 2k - 3 sec
- Pyramid: 2k pace
- 4×1000m: 2k + 1 sec
- 5×1500m: 5k pace
- 4×2000m: 5k + 0.5 sec
- 3k, 2.5k, 2k: 5k + 1 sec

**Pyramid Pacing**: Constant pace 250m → 1k, speed up after 1k if able (don't sprint the first 250m)

## Key Principles
- **Continuous Progress**: Each cycle, beat previous session average (sustainable improvement)
- **80/20 Balance**: Majority of training is steady distance (aerobic base), ~20% high intensity
- **Simplicity**: Easy to follow, constant feedback on progress
- **Flexibility**: Adjust volume/intensity to fit schedule and racing calendar
- **Recovery**: Always take weekly rest day (as important as training sessions)
