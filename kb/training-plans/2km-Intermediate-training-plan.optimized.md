# Intermediate 2k Training Plan (8 Weeks)

## Target Audience
Decent fitness level (train 2×/week regularly). Build to 3×/week on indoor rower. Improve 2000m performance and general fitness.

## Training Guidelines

| Element | Details |
|---|---|
| **Warm-up** | 5-10 min on other equipment + dynamic stretching |
| **Cool-down** | 3 min light rowing + static stretch (glutes, hamstrings, quads) |
| **Technique** | Drive: LEGS flat → BODY lean back → ARMS pull. Recovery: ARMS → BODY → LEGS. |
| **Split** | Time to row 500m. Lower split = harder work. Keep consistent. Display: 0:00/500m. |
| **Damper** | Set to ≤4 for good technique maintenance |
| **SPM (Strokes/Min)** | ↑ Rate = ↓ Split (rowing faster). Lower rate = sustainable longer. |
| **Cross Training** | Other cardio equipment to supplement training, build endurance with variety |

## Supplemental Training (Weekly)
- **Strength:** Squats, lunges
- **Core:** Plank, side plank, dorsal raises (lower back focus)
- **Flexibility:** Hip flexors, calves

## Phase 1: Weeks 1-4 (Rate Control & Endurance)

**Monthly Goal:** Control stroke rate while maintaining strong leg drive. Build endurance off rowing machine.

**Session 3 (all weeks):** Cross-training 10-15 min on any cardio equipment

### Week 1
- **Session 1:** 2 min @ 20 SPM, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 24, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 20
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 90s rest) × 3, 3 min rest, (1 min row, 90s rest) × 3

### Week 2
- **Session 1:** 2 min @ 20, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 24, 2' @ 24, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 20
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 90s rest) × 3, 2 min rest, (1 min row, 90s rest) × 3

### Week 3
- **Session 1:** 2' @ 20, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 24, 1' @ 26, 2' @ 24, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 20
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3, 3 min rest, (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3

### Week 4
- **Session 1:** 2' @ 20, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 24, 2' @ 26, 2' @ 24, 2' @ 22, 2' @ 20
- **Session 2:** (1 min @ 26-28, 1 min rest) × 3, 3 min rest, (1 min @ 24-26, 1 min rest) × 3

## Phase 2: Weeks 5-8 (Endurance Testing)

**Monthly Goal:** Build endurance with two 1000m tests. Understand fitness needed for 2000m goal.

**Session 3 (all weeks):** Cross-training 15 min on any cardio equipment

### Week 5
- **Session 1:** 3' @ 20, 3' @ 22, 2' @ 24, 3' @ 22, 3' @ 20
- **Session 2:** 1000m row, 4 min rest, 1000m row
  - *Pacing:* Slightly higher split on Set 1 to maintain in Set 2 (consistency goal)

### Week 6
- **Session 1:** 3' @ 20, 3' @ 22, 3' @ 24, 3' @ 22, 3' @ 20
- **Session 2:** (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3, 2 min rest, (1 min row, 1 min rest) × 3

### Week 7
- **Session 1:** 3' @ 20, 2' @ 22, 1' @ 24, 1' @ 26, 1' @ 24, 2' @ 22, 3' @ 20
- **Session 2:** 1000m row, 2.5 min rest, 1000m row

### Week 8: Final 2k Test
- **Session 1:** 2000m row
  - *Pacing Strategy:* Hold split slightly higher than Week 7 1000m for first 1000m to achieve consistency in final 1000m

## Progression Patterns
- **Duration:** 10 min → 15 min total work
- **Rest intervals:** 90s → 60s (Weeks 1-4)
- **Stroke rate:** 20-22 → 24-28 SPM progression
- **Distance:** 1 min pieces → 1000m pieces → 2000m
- **Intensity:** Rate control → sustained pieces → race effort

## Key Success Metrics
- Consistent splits across intervals
- Maintain technique at higher rates
- 1000m pacing informs 2k strategy
- Cross-training builds aerobic base
- Ready for advanced plan post-completion
