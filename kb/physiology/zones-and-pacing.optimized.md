# Training Zones and Pacing Guide

## Zone Reference Table

| Zone | Purpose | HR (%max) | Pace vs 2k | Pace vs 6k | SPM | RPE | Feel |
|------|---------|-----------|------------|------------|-----|-----|------|
| **UT2** | Easy aerobic base, technique, recovery | 55–75% | +18 to +30s | +8 to +30s | 16–20 | 1–4 | Conversational, very easy |
| **UT1** | Firm steady aerobic, upper base | 70–85% | +10 to +18s | +2 to +12s | 18–24 | 4–6 | Strong breathing, broken conversation |
| **AT** | Threshold, raise lactate threshold | 80–90% | +0 to +10s | -5 to +3s | 22–28 | 6–8 | Comfortably hard, sustainable 20–40 min |
| **TR** | VO₂max intervals, high aerobic | 85–97% | -6 to 0s | -12 to -4s | 26–32 | 8–9 | Very hard, 3–6 min intervals |
| **AN** | Sprints, power, starts | ≥95% | All-out (250m-1000m) | N/A | 32+ | 10 | Maximal effort, short duration |

## Key Guidelines

**Use Multiple Indicators:**
- Combine HR + split/power + RPE together
- HR drifts on long pieces; use as guide, not sole arbiter
- For TR/AN work, rely more on power/splits than HR (HR lags)

**Intensity Distribution (80/20 Rule):**
- 80% of weekly training in UT2/UT1 (low intensity)
- 20% in AT/TR/AN combined (threshold + high intensity)
- Avoid excessive "gray zone" (mid-intensity) training

**Testing-Based Pacing:**
- Use recent 2k test to set training paces
- Use 6k test for threshold/endurance assessment
- Lactate step test for precise zone boundaries (2mmol = aerobic threshold, 4mmol = anaerobic threshold)

**Practical Notes:**
- UT2 bands are intentionally wide to accommodate different programs and athlete levels
- Some coaches allow UT2 up to +30s on very long base rows
- HR overlap between zones is normal; individual lactate testing refines boundaries
- For short AN work, HR is unreliable—use power output and rest quality

*These are liberal, high-level starting bands. Fine-tune from recent tests (2k/6k/lactate) and adjust based on individual response.*
