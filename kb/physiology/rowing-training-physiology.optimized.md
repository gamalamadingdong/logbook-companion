# Rowing Training Physiology: Optimized Summary

## 1. Energy Systems in Rowing
- **2k race (6–7 min):** 80–85% aerobic, 15–20% anaerobic
- **6k test (18–24 min):** 90–95% aerobic
- **Steady-state (60+ min):** ~100% aerobic
- **500m sprint (90 sec):** 70–75% anaerobic
- **Key:** Aerobic system dominates all standard race distances; anaerobic systems provide start/sprint power.

## 2. Training Zones (Concept2/British Rowing)
| Zone | Name         | Intensity         | Purpose                        | Markers (HRmax, Lactate, RPE) |
|------|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| UT2  | Utilization2 | Low aerobic       | Base, recovery, technique      | 55–70%, <2mmol, RPE 1–2       |
| UT1  | Utilization1 | Mod. aerobic      | Endurance, aerobic efficiency  | 70–80%, 2–3mmol, RPE 3–4      |
| AT   | Anaer. Thresh| Threshold         | Raise threshold, hard aerobic  | 80–85%, ~4mmol, RPE 5–6       |
| TR   | Transport    | High aerobic      | VO₂max, speed endurance        | 85–95%, 6–8mmol, RPE 7–8      |
| AN   | Anaerobic    | Maximal           | Sprints, power, tolerance      | 95%+, >8mmol, RPE 9–10        |

- **Distribution:** 80% UT2/UT1, 20% AT/TR/AN (polarized/pyramidal)
- **Pete Plan:** Alternates steady (UT2/UT1) and interval (AT/TR/AN) days
- **Wolverine Plan:** Explicit levels, high volume of Level 4 (UT2/UT1), 1–2 high-intensity days/week

## 3. Key Adaptations
- **Cardiovascular:** Increased heart size, stroke volume, VO₂max (elite: 60-70+ ml/kg/min for heavyweights, 70-80+ for lightweights)
- **Muscular:** Endurance and strength in legs, core, upper body; improved buffering, lactate clearance
- **Metabolic:** More mitochondria, capillaries, fat oxidation, glycogen storage
- **Note:** Power at 4mmol lactate correlates 0.85-0.95 with 2k performance—key training target

## 4. Periodization Model
- **Base (Prep):** High volume (↑km/week progressively), low intensity (75% UT2/UT1, 20% UT1/AT, 5% high), strength focus
- **Build (Specific):** Maintain volume, add threshold/VO₂max work (shift toward 70% UT2/UT1, 10% AT, 20% TR/AN)
- **Peak (Competition):** Polarized distribution (80% UT2/UT1, 5% AT, 15% TR/AN), taper volume 20-40%, maintain intensity
- **Recovery (Off-season):** Low volume, cross-training, technique focus
- **In-season:** Short cycles between races (recovery micro → build → mini-taper)
- **Progression:** Pyramidal (base) → Polarized (peak) as season advances

## 5. Testing Protocols
- **2k Erg Test:** Benchmark, sets training paces
- **6k/5k Test:** Aerobic capacity, threshold
- **Lactate Step Test:** Determines UT1/AT/thresholds (2mmol = aerobic, 4mmol = anaerobic threshold)
- **VO₂max Test:** Max aerobic power (less common outside labs)
- **On-water seat racing:** Technical/selection

## 6. Training Load & Fatigue Management
- **Track:** Weekly volume (km/min), HR, session RPE, TRIMP, wellness
- **Monitor:** Acute:chronic load ratio, HRV, mood, performance trends
- **Deload:** Every 3–4 weeks, reduce volume to prevent overtraining

## 7. Practical Guidelines & Workout Examples
- **80/20 rule:** Majority of training at low intensity (avoid "gray zone" overtraining)
- **Test regularly:** Use 2k/6k/lactate to set zones and track progress every 6-8 weeks
- **Periodize:** Build base → add intensity → peak → recover (traditional periodization works)
- **Balance:** Endurance, threshold, VO₂max, and anaerobic work throughout year
- **Monitor fatigue:** Adjust load based on recovery, HRV, and performance trends

**Sample Workouts by Zone:**
- UT2: 60-90' steady (conversational), 2×30' with 5' rest, long technique rows
- UT1: 2×20' firm steady, 3×15' with 3' rest, sustained aerobic work
- AT: 3×10' at threshold, 2×20' tempo, 4×8' with 2' rest (race pace training)
- TR: 5×4' VO₂max intervals (3' rest), 8×2' (2' rest), 6×5' (5' rest)
- AN: 8×500m (3' rest), 10×250m (2' rest), race starts/sprint finishes
