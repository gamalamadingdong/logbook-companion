Good — I reviewed the rowing physiology and plan notes and broadened the heart‑rate and pacing bands to be explicitly liberal (as you asked). Below is a compact reference table you can use as high‑level indicators. I’ve cited the source material I used so you can see the basis for the wider bands (testing literature, Pete/Wolverine plan notes, and the zone summaries).

Note: these are wide, intentionally conservative bands to be used as starting points. Always fine‑tune from a recent 2k/6k test or a lactate/HR step test and combine HR + RPE + split because HR lags and drifts over long pieces (use HR as a guide, not the only arbiter) .

Table — liberal (high‑level) training zone bands

Zone — Purpose	Liberal HR (approx % HR_max)	Liberal pace vs your recent 2k (s/500m)	Liberal pace vs your recent 6k (s/500m)	Short note / feel
UT2 — Easy aerobic/base, long technique meters	55–75% HR_max (liberal)	2k +18 to +30 s/500m (very easy; some coaches allow up to +30s on very long rows)	Typically slower than 6k pace: ≈6k +8 to +30 s/500m (liberal)	Conversational, low SPM (16–20); RPE 1–4. Use this a lot — easy work builds the base
UT1 — Firm/steady aerobic (upper base)	70–85% HR_max (liberal window)	2k +10 to +18 s/500m (sustained but controlled)	Around or a bit slower than 6k: ≈6k +2 to +12 s/500m (liberal)	Stronger breathing, broken conversation; SPM ~18–24; RPE 4–6
AT — Anaerobic / lactate threshold (raise LT)	80–90% HR_max (liberal; often near LT2)	2k +0 to +10 s/500m (hard, sustainable ~20–40 min pieces) — liberally allow up to +12 for less trained athletes	Around 6k pace to slightly faster: ≈6k −5 to +3 s/500m (liberal)	“Comfortably hard”; SPM ~22–28; RPE 6–8. Good for 20–40’ work to raise threshold
TR — VO₂max / high aerobic intervals	85–97% HR_max (liberal; note HR may not reach true max on very short reps)	Around 2k pace to up to 2k −6 s/500m on short intervals (e.g., VO₂max repeats) — liberal: 2k −6 to 0 s/500m	Clearly faster than 6k: ≈6k −4 to −12 s/500m (liberal)	Very hard intervals (3–6 min); SPM 26–32; RPE 8–9. Use short reps with quality rest
AN — Anaerobic / sprint (starts, power)	≥95% HR_max (heart rate can lag — rely on power/RPE for very short reps)	All‑out much faster than 2k for short reps (250–1000m sprints); no single 2k offset fits all — treat as maximal efforts	Not set from 6k — use power/duration prescription	Max SPM (32+), very short duration, RPE ~10. Requires long recovery; HR is not a reliable immediate marker here
Why I widened these bands

Literature and coaching notes commonly report UT2 as ~65–75% HR_max and many coaches allow UT2 paces up to +25–30 s/500m relative to 2k on long base pieces — so a 55–75% HR band and a 2k +18–30s pace band cover conservative to more liberal practice across programs .
UT1/AT boundaries vary by athlete and testing method; British/WorldRowing schemes and practical coach notes show UT1 often spans mid 70s to mid 80s% HR_max and AT sits near ~80–90% HR_max (LT2). I expanded UT1/AT HR overlap accordingly because some athletes’ LT1 and LT2 fall close together and test methods differ .
VO₂max/TR and AN work are intensity domains where HR is noisy (lag and peak timing). That’s why I flagged that HR should be supplemented with split/power and RPE for these zones .
Many plans (Pete/Wolverine) use 2k and 6k tests to set paces; those same sources use relative offsets similar to the ranges above (2k +15–25 for steady; AT close to 2k or a little slower; TR at/above 2k pace) so anchoring to 2k/6k is practical and consistent with the literature .

Practical guidance for using these liberal bands
Use HR + split/power + RPE together — if HR drifts upward during long UT2 rows but RPE and power show you’re still easy, stay easy (HR drift is common) .
If you want narrower bands for prescriptions, do one of: a lactate step test or a 20–30 min threshold test (to estimate LT1/LT2), or give me a recent 2k and 6k and I’ll compute athlete‑specific splits from these liberal bands .
For TR/AN work rely more on power/splits and number-of-reps/rest quality than HR; HR will often not peak until the reps are well underway or after the rep ends .

Next steps — pick one
I can convert the table above to a downloadable CSV for import.
Or, if you share a recent 2k and/or 6k time (or allow me to pull your PRs), I’ll compute the explicit split ranges for each zone for your exact numbers.
Or I can produce a narrower “performance” band set (for competitive athletes) vs a “beginner/recreational” band set.

Which would you prefer?
