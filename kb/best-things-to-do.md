# Quick Wins: Best Things To Do

- **Build a base first:** Stack 4-5 easy UT2/UT1 steady sessions each week to raise aerobic capacity without burning out.
- **Add 1-2 quality intervals:** Layer one threshold piece (20-30 minutes continuous or broken) and one VO2max-style session (e.g., 4x4-6 minutes) for speed.
- **Lift and prehab twice weekly:** Prioritize posterior-chain strength, core stability, and shoulder control to protect the back and ribs.
- **Drill technique every outing:** Use pick drill, pauses (arms-away/body-over), and feet-out rowing to reinforce sequencing and balance.
- **Dial in recovery:** Sleep 8-9 hours, refuel within 30-60 minutes post-session, hydrate, and schedule at least one lighter/recovery day.
- **Test and recalibrate:** Recheck 2k/6k or a 30-minute piece every 4-6 weeks to reset training paces and track progress.
- **Log everything:** Sync Concept2 data (or record manually) so volume, intensity, and trends stay visible for adjustments.
- **Plan weekly:** Map total meters, intensity mix (80/20 pyramidal), and race-specific practices so hard days and easy days stay distinct.
