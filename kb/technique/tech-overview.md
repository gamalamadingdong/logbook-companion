# Comprehensive Rowing Technique Guide (Indoor & On-Water)

**Rowing** is a full-body, technically demanding sport that uses nearly all major muscle groups in a coordinated sequence. Mastering proper technique is crucial for maximizing power transfer to the boat (or ergometer) efficiently and reducing injury risk. This guide covers optimal stroke mechanics, common faults and corrections (with evidence-based fixes), drill progressions from elite programs, key biomechanical principles, differences between ergometer and on-water rowing, and how technical focus evolves from beginners to advanced rowers. Throughout, we include coaching cues and cite insights from peer-reviewed research, biomechanics experts, and respected rowing organizations (e.g. British Rowing, USRowing, Concept2).

## 1. Optimal Stroke Mechanics & Sequencing

A rowing stroke consists of four phases – **Catch**, **Drive**, **Finish**, and **Recovery** – executed in one continuous, fluid motion. Each phase has specific body positions and movements that, when done correctly, maximize power and maintain efficiency. Below is a breakdown of each phase: [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)

### **1.1 The Catch**

*   **Body Position:** At the catch (the **start** of the stroke), the rower is **compressed forward** on the sliding seat: knees bent, shins vertical, hips flexed, shoulders relaxed and **forward of the hips**, arms fully extended, and back **straight but leaned forward** (approx. 1 o’clock position). This position loads the legs and engages core muscles, priming the rower for a powerful leg drive. The chest is up, eyes forward, and weight is shifted towards the balls of the feet, ready to push. [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/), [\[physiohunt.com\]](https://physiohunt.com/subject/biomech/Biomechanics_of_rowing.php)

*   **Blade Entry:** In on-water rowing, the blade is **quickly squared and placed into the water** at the catch in one smooth motion **just before the drive begins**. A sharp **“catch”** minimizes water slip: the goal is to get the blade locked in with minimal loss of length. Coaches often cue *“catch through the feet”* – meaning apply pressure to the foot stretcher at the moment the blade enters, to anchor the blade. A small **backsplash** (water thrown toward the bow) on entry indicates the blade was placed confidently and slightly before the leg drive, which helps eliminate “skying” (when blades are too high and miss the water). *Cue:* **“Quick catch, then leg drive.”** [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke) [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/causes-skying-catch/)

*   **Timing:** The catch should *flow* from the recovery without hesitation. There is no pause; the blade entry and leg drive connection happen almost simultaneously. A common cue is **“heels down”** right after the catch, reminding rowers to drive their heels as the blade enters. **Good timing at the catch is critical** – any delay means lost potential length and wasted effort. In terms of biomechanics, a rapid connection at the catch improves the stroke’s **effective length** by reducing *catch slip* (degrees of arc before force is applied). Elite rowers achieve very small catch slips by having precise catch timing and blade placement. [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/)

### **1.2 The Drive**

*   **Sequencing:** The drive phase is the **power phase** where the rower propels the boat/erg. The sequence is **Legs → Body (back) → Arms**, in that order. At the **beginning of the drive**, the **legs** do the work **while the torso remains leaned forward and the arms remain straight**, transferring leg power to the handle. **Only after** the legs are mostly extended does the body swing back (from roughly 1 o’clock forward to about 11 o’clock back), and **only after** the body swing do the arms finally pull in. This coordinated sequence uses the strongest muscle groups first (legs and glutes), then adds the back, then the smaller arm muscles last. [\[physiohunt.com\]](https://physiohunt.com/subject/biomech/Biomechanics_of_rowing.php) [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)

*   **Leg Drive & Connection:** **Legs initiate the drive** explosively. The cue *“Press through the footplate”* or **“legs first!”** reinforces that the rower should hang off the handle with straight arms as the legs push. This leg-driven start is often called the “hang” or “suspension” – the feeling of body weight suspended between handle and foot stretcher as the boat accelerates. Biomechanically, a **strong, rapid leg drive** not only produces most of the power (on-water, legs contribute \~**45%** of total stroke power), but also results in a high **Rate of Force Development (RFD)** – a hallmark of effective strokes. Research shows successful rowers generate force quickly with the legs, achieving peak force relatively early in the drive (when the oar is \~15–20° past the catch). [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/) [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/)

*   **Body Swing:** As the leg drive nears completion (legs about 75-90% extended), the **hips open and the torso swings back** from the hips (from the forward “catch angle” to a backward “layback” angle). The back swing adds additional length and power to the drive. During this swing, the core must remain braced to efficiently transfer force. Coaches might say **“finish the leg drive, then swing”** or use a call like *“hips swing through”*. The legs and trunk overlap slightly – in practice, the **back begins to swing just after the legs peak in force**, so there is a smooth transition. This overlap ensures continuous acceleration. *Cue:* **“Legs then hips.”** [\[physiohunt.com\]](https://physiohunt.com/subject/biomech/Biomechanics_of_rowing.php) [\[row2k.com\]](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/)

*   **Arm Pull:** In the final part of the drive, the **arms bend to draw the handle to the body**. This occurs once the back is swinging or nearly finished – the arms **add** the last bit of handle speed. The arms should pull straight in toward the lower ribs. Elbows go out to the sides (for sweep rowers, outside elbow out and wrist flat; for scullers, both elbows out). *Cue:* **“Last 10% – arms.”** It’s important that arms **do not** pull too early; keeping them straight through most of the drive allows the larger leg/back muscles to handle the load. Only at the finish do the biceps and upper back fully engage to bring the handle in. [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/) [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/)

*   **Power Application:** The drive should feel like a continuous acceleration. An effective cue is *“push then swing then pull”*, emphasizing each segment. **Maintaining pressure** on the handle and foot stretcher through the entire drive is key to boat speed. Any section of the drive where force drops (e.g. if one opens up too early or pauses) will check acceleration. Ideally, the force curve (handle force vs. time) is smooth and front-loaded (high early with the legs), indicating a connected catch and powerful leg drive. Coaches often remind athletes to **“hold the pressure through the finish”**, meaning don’t let off early. By the end of the drive, the boat attains its peak speed for that stroke. [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/)

*   **Example – On Water:** *“As the stroke begins, the rower is coiled forward... At the beginning of the drive, the body position doesn't change – all the work is done by the legs. As the upper body begins to uncoil, the arms begin their work...”*. This description from USRowing encapsulates the ideal drive sequence. [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)

### **1.3 The Finish**

*   **Body Position:** At the finish, the rower completes the drive and prepares to extract the oar. The legs are fully extended, the **body is leaning back slightly** (a **layback** of \~15° past vertical, using strong core support), and the **arms are bent, pulling the handle into the torso**. Handle height at the finish is roughly at the lower ribs (just below the chest); elbows are out and level with the handle, wrists flat. The rower sits up tall – even with layback, the core is engaged and posture strong (no slumping). [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/) [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/causes-skying-catch/)

*   **Handle Movement & Blade Extraction:** **Finish the stroke by driving the hands down and away**: the hands push down slightly to **“tap” the blade out of the water**. In sweep rowing, the outside hand presses down on the handle to pop the blade out *square*, and the inside hand feathers the blade immediately once clear. In sculling, both hands tap down together and feather the blades. The timing of this is critical: *first* the blade comes out, *then* it feathers. A common saying is **“tap down, then feather”** (to avoid feathering too early underwater). If done correctly, the blade slips out with minimal disturbance, and the water behind the blade (the puddle) is left spinning symmetrically. [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke), [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/)

*   **Maintaining Connection:** Even at the finish, the rower should **stay connected** to the boat through the feet. Coaches often cue *“legs down, core braced at finish”* – meaning don’t shrug or collapse as you pull in the arms. Keeping pressure on the foot stretcher as you draw in helps stabilize the body and maintain boat speed. A good finish has the feeling of **squeezing the last bit of send** on the boat: *“finish strong through the handle.”* However, **avoid yanking** or overleaning too far back – excessive layback can actually drop power and put strain on the lower back. [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/) [\[concept2.com\]](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique)

*   **The Release:** As the handle is tapped down, the boat is at its fastest point in the cycle. A clean release (sometimes called *“clean extraction”*) is when the blade comes out without water splashing or “sucking” on it. If done properly, all rowers’ blades release together, keeping the shell balanced. **Washing out** is a common error here (blade comes out **too early** while still loaded, often due to pulling the hands into the lap or dropping them; this creates splash and loss of run). The fix is to **keep the blade covered until the drive is truly finished**, then tap out sharply. (See Faults & Corrections section below for more on washing out.) [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/) [\[row2k.com\]](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/)

*   **Feathering:** Immediately after the blade is out, it’s feathered (turned horizontal) during the first part of the recovery. This reduces wind resistance and eases the blade’s return. *Cue:* **“Down and away”** – a reminder to push the handle down to remove the blade, then send hands away from the body towards the bow. The motion is quick and fluid. USRowing’s technique summary notes: *“During the finish, the oar handle is moved down, drawing the oarblade out, and the rower feathers the oar – turning the blade from vertical to horizontal.”*. [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)

### **1.4 The Recovery**

*   **Sequence (Arms-Body-Legs):** The recovery is essentially the **reverse order** of the drive: **Arms away, then body forward, then legs compress**. Right after the finish, the **hands move smoothly away from the body** at the same speed they came in. Then the **body pivots forward** from the hips, returning from layback to a forward lean. Only once the arms are straight and the body is leaned forward do the **knees bend** to let the seat slide toward the catch. Coaches often simplify this with the cue **“Arms, Body, Slide”** (or *“hands away, body over, then slide”*). This sequencing ensures the weight of the upper body moves toward the stern *before* the seat, helping the boat glide (and on the erg, it allows the flywheel to keep spinning freely). [\[physiohunt.com\]](https://physiohunt.com/subject/biomech/Biomechanics_of_rowing.php) [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke) [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/)

*   **Ratio & Control:** A defining feature of good rowing is the **ratio** between drive and recovery. The drive is quick and powerful, and the recovery is longer and controlled. Often a **2:1 recovery:drive time ratio** is encouraged (i.e., recovery takes roughly twice as long as the drive). This does **not** mean hesitating, but rather flowing slowly enough on recovery to let the boat run underneath. *Cues:* “**Slow up the slide**,” or for crews, “**Relax, let it run**.” On an erg, rowers sometimes count “**1 (drive), 2-3 (recovery)**” to ingrain a longer recovery. Proper ratio improves boat speed because rushing the recovery can cause **boat check** (a deceleration due to abrupt movement of mass towards the bow). Biomechanically, a slower recovery also allows muscles a brief partial rest and the next drive to be more effective. [\[physiohunt.com\]](https://physiohunt.com/subject/biomech/Biomechanics_of_rowing.php) [\[concept2.com\]](https://www.concept2.com/training/rowing-drills) [\[concept2.com\]](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique)

*   **Body Preparation:** During the recovery, rowers **prepare their body position for the next catch**. By mid-recovery, the arms are extended and the torso is hinging forward past the hips (often reference: hands over knees, body at \~11 o’clock forward by half-slide). The core remains engaged to support a flat back. Knees rise steadily as the seat moves forward **only after the hands and body are set forward**. Rowers think of “*floating*” up the slide, keeping pressure light on the seat. The handle and seat should **move in sync**; a common cue is *“handle and seat move together”* (if the seat slides without handle movement, that’s *shooting the slide* fault). By the end of the recovery (the catch position), the rower should be in the strong posture described in **1.1**. [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/)

*   **Slide Length:** Rowers strive for an optimal stroke length on each recovery. This means compressing to the catch **without over-compressing**. The shins should be vertical at the catch; reaching farther (heels lifting too much, or knees past ankles) can be counterproductive. Over-compression leads to a weaker position (lost tension in legs) and can cause the seat to hit your heels, disrupting rhythm. Athletes are often told to find a **“comfortable stretch”** at the catch – maximum reach while maintaining a straight back and engaged core. Many use a **strapless rowing drill** (feet out of straps) during practice, which naturally teaches the appropriate slide length because if you over-compress or tug, your feet lift off (more on strapless in drills). [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/) [\[concept2.com\]](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique)

*   **Recovery on the Erg vs Boat:** On the ergometer, there is no boat moving beneath, but the same principles apply: hands away quickly, controlled forward swing, then slide. *Important:* do not tug yourself forward with the feet straps; instead **proactively swing forward and let the seat come up**. On-water, during recovery the boat is actually moving under the rower – one must be even more mindful not to abruptly rush up the slide, or the boat’s momentum gets slowed.

*   **Summary of Recovery:** Per USRowing: *“The oar remains out of the water as the rower begins the recovery, moving the hands away from the body and past the knees. The body follows the hands and the sliding seat moves forward, until, knees bent, the rower is ready for the next catch.”*. This succinctly captures the continuous flow into the next stroke. [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)

**Coaching Cues for the Stroke Cycle:**

*   *“Legs–Body–Arms; Arms–Body–Legs.”* – Reminder of the drive vs recovery order.
*   *“Push don't pull.”* – Emphasizes initiating power with the legs (hang on the handle).
*   *“Hang off the handle.”* – Feel body weight suspended through straight arms at the catch.
*   *“Back tall at finish.”* – Don’t collapse at the end of the drive; sit up and tap out.
*   *“Slow slide, quick catch.”* – Controlled recovery, then decisive catch.
*   *“Keep it smooth and long.”* – No jerky motions; maximize length in water.

These short phrases help athletes remember the desired feelings and sequencing during each phase of the stroke.

## 2. Common Technical Faults & Corrections (Evidence-Based)

Even experienced rowers constantly refine technique to eliminate faults. Below are **common technical errors** and how to fix them, with explanations grounded in biomechanics and expert coaching practices:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Fault</th>
    <th>Symptoms & Causes</th>
    <th>Correction & Cues</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Early Arm Pull</strong> (grabbing with arms at start of drive)</td>
    <td>Arms bend too soon on the drive, reducing leg power transfer. The rower “pulls” with biceps instead of hanging. This often stems from impatience or a misconception that pulling harder = more power. In reality, it disrupts the force application: bending early means the **legs’ power isn’t fully transmitted** to the handle[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). It also fatigues the smaller arm muscles quickly.</td>
    <td>Keep arms straight and **“hang on the handle”** during leg drive[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). Focus on driving with legs *while shoulders and arms stay relaxed*. Cue: <em>“Push first, pull last.”</em> Drill: Do legs-only or legs-and-body rowing (part of the pick drill) to ingrain leg-drive-first. Another drill is the “suspension drill” where you strap the handle to the flywheel at the catch and push – it teaches the feeling of legs working while arms stay straight[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). Think of arms as **hooks or chains** connecting your body to the handle (they shouldn’t flex until the final part of drive).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Early Body Opening</strong> (back opens too soon) / <strong>Shooting the Slide</strong> (legs push but body lags)</td>
    <td>These are opposite timing errors in the leg-back sequencing. <u>Early body opening</u>: the athlete swings the back open *before* the leg drive is complete, often accompanied by shoulders rising too early. This uses back too soon and under-utilizes leg power. It can be seen as a sharp drop in force after the catch (legs didn’t sustain pressure). <u>Shooting the slide</u>: the legs drive but the hips aren’t braced, so the seat flies back faster than the handle – the trunk hasn’t engaged, resulting in a slack moment (the rower’s butt moves but handle doesn’t, wasting energy)[9](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique). Both faults upset the smooth power curve and timing.
    </td>
    <td>For early back opening: Emphasize **legs first, back stays forward initially**. Cue: <em>“Stay hinged at the hips until legs are almost down.”</em> Feel the core engaged, holding body angle forward as you press the legs. Drill: legs-only strokes, and pauses at half-drive (when legs ~ halfway down) to check body position (should still be forward).  
        For shooting the slide: Focus on keeping the **handle and seat moving together** – if the seat jumps out ahead, you’re not connected[9](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique). Engage the core before the catch (a **firm core** transmits leg drive to handle). Cue: <em>“Brace and push – take the handle with you.”</em> A helpful exercise is rowing with a resistance band around the midsection of the erg (to provide feedback if hips shoot too fast), or having someone gently hold the handle at the catch while you push with legs – if your legs drive and arms stay straight, the handle and seat should move as one. Also, check footstretcher position and flexibility; over-compression can cause timing issues. Both faults are fixed by reinforcing the overlap: drive the legs **through** before swinging back, and keep core tight so the body pivot happens at the right time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Rushing the Slide</strong> (fast up the recovery, poor ratio)</td>
    <td>The recovery is executed too quickly, with little control – the seat races toward the catch. This leads to a **short pause at catch** (or missing water) and often a feeling of “jerkiness” between strokes. Boat-wise, rushing causes the shell to check/brake noticeably each stroke as the mass of the rower moves forward abruptly. It’s often caused by nervousness or attempting to achieve higher stroke rate improperly. On an erg, rushing can be seen as very short recovery relative to drive (low ratio). The athlete may also have difficulty getting into the proper catch position if they rush (insufficient time to roll forward).</td>
    <td>Think <strong>“Slow is smooth, smooth is fast”</strong> on the recovery. Commit to a consistent recovery ratio (e.g. 2:1). Cue: <em>“Let it run under you.”</em> Actively slow down the seat after hands and body are set – feel the wheels almost decelerate slightly as you approach the catch. Use the **recovery for breathing** (inhale as you come forward slowly), which naturally sets a rhythm. Drill: Pause drills can help (e.g., pause at hands-away or at half-slide to break the habit of rushing). Also, *counting the recovery* (as Concept2 suggests: say “1” on drive, “2-3” on recovery) enforces a longer slide[11](https://www.concept2.com/training/rowing-drills). Another approach: row feet-out (strapless) – if you rush slide with no straps, you’ll likely feel unstable at the catch, so it teaches controlled approach. The evidence for ratio: A slower recovery improves boat speed by reducing deceleration[3](https://physiohunt.com/subject/biomech/Biomechanics_of_rowing.php); hence, top crews emphasize enjoying the recovery, not attacking it. *Cue:* **“Relax on the recovery, prepare for next stroke.”**</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Bending Knees Too Early on Recovery</strong></td>
    <td>The rower breaks the knees before the hands and body have cleared, causing the hands/handle to collide with or rise over the knees. This is often called *“rowing over your knees”*. It disrupts the smooth recovery and usually shortens the stroke (can’t get fully forward). It’s caused by not focusing on getting hands away and body over. You’ll see a rower’s knees popping up as soon as they finish, forcing their hands to route awkwardly upward to avoid the knees[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). This also can upset boat set (balance).</td>
    <td>Drill the proper recovery order: **Hands away, then body over, then slide**. Cue: <em>“Hands and body first – legs wait.”</em> A good correction is to consciously delay bending the knees until the handle passes over them. On an erg, you can practice by exaggerating hands-away speed and counting “hands, body, knees.” Another drill: Arms-and-body only rowing (no legs) reinforces keeping knees down until arms/torso have moved[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). Also, **pause drills** right after arms-away can instill muscle memory: finish stroke, release hands, pause for a second with arms out and body forward, then roll up. Once this sequence is habit, the knees naturally won’t interfere. *Top tip:* Rowing strapless (feet out) also punishes early knee bend; if you pop knees early, you’ll lose connection and feel it. The key is developing a smooth fluid recovery where knees only rise when they must.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Over-Compression at the Catch</strong> (excessive slide length / “dives” at catch)</td>
    <td>The rower tucks up too tightly at the catch: seats hitting heels, shins past vertical, back rounded, possibly butt tucking under. This “diving” forward can feel like getting a bit **too close** to the front stops. It often results in blades going deep at the catch (if on water) or just a weak position to start the drive (legs are compressed beyond their strong range)[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/)[9](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique). Over-compression can stem from trying to get more length improperly or having very flexible ankles without control. Biomechanically it’s counterproductive: beyond a certain point, extra slide doesn’t add propulsive length (the oar angle might not improve much) but it does put the rower in a less forceful posture.</td>
    <td>The solution is to find the *optimal* catch position. **Shins vertical** (or even slightly less) is a good reference[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). Cue: <em>“Feel the tension: don’t collapse at catch.”</em> There should be a small “triangle of air” between calf and thigh at the catch[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/) – i.e., avoid fully compressing until heels hit glutes. To train this, many rowers use a **slide stopper**: e.g., put tape on the slide where the optimal catch is, and aim to not slide past it[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). Also, the *strapless rowing* drill is excellent: if you over-compress strapless, your feet will lose contact, immediately indicating the fault[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). Work on hip mobility and posture so you can reach forward comfortably *without* needing excessive knee angle. *Cue:* **“Reach with your arms and shoulders, not by hunching knees too much.”** Essentially, once shins are vertical and torso is at your forward angle, that’s enough – any more slide just collapses your power. By fixing this, you’ll achieve a stronger catch position ready to push.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Skying the Blade at the Catch</strong> (blade too high off water, then slapping down)</td>
    <td>“Skying” means as the rower comes into the catch on the water, the blade is lifted too high (usually from hands dropping), causing the blade to be almost vertical in air. The rower then often **plunges the blade down** to catch, losing precious time and length. This fault is visible as blades rising up (“aiming at the sky”) just before entry. Causes: often **hands dropping** during the recovery or as they square the blade, or approaching catch with arms too high then dipping quickly. It can also be related to rigging (if rig is too low, athletes might sky trying to find the water). Skying leads to missed water at the catch – effectively shortening the stroke – and a less direct catch. 
    </td>
    <td>Focus on **carry the hands at a consistent height into the catch**. Through the recovery, the handle should travel horizontally at the correct height off the water (just enough to clear the waves)[4](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/causes-skying-catch/). Cue: <em>“Level hands into the front”</em> and <em>“raise the blade only as you place it”</em> (i.e., don’t lift hands too early). Drills: **Square blade rowing** (rowing without feathering) can help because it forces athletes to carry blades just off the water - if they sky, it’s immediately obvious (blade will go too high). Another drill is the backsplash drill: deliberately create a small splash at the catch by placing the blade quickly – this teaches the correct subtle lift of hands *at* the catch, not before[4](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/causes-skying-catch/). Also check rigging: ensure the oarlock height is appropriate so that with blade squared at catch, the handle is about at mid-chest height[4](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/causes-skying-catch/). Once rigged right, it’s down to habit. Rebecca Caroe (coach) suggests unlearning the over-lift: practice with half the crew to stabilize the boat and do repeated catches focusing on a **tiny backsplash and no skying**, then feather normally[4](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/causes-skying-catch/). *Cue:* **“Don’t drop your hands on the square; carry them in.”** This will eliminate the upward blade trajectory. Over time, consistent blade heights through the recovery will cure skying.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Digging/Diving the Blade</strong> (burying too deep during drive)</td>
    <td>This is when the blade goes too deep in the water during the drive (often submerging a large portion of the oar shaft). It usually happens if a rower lifts their body or arms during the drive, or doesn’t tap down in time. “Diving” at the catch is a related issue where the rower lunges too far and the blade goes deep initially[10](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/). The effect is inefficient: a deeply buried blade wastes energy moving water (turning it to froth) rather than propelling the boat[8](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/). It can also unbalance the boat. Often the rower’s **shoulders might lift (shrug) or they might over-pull** with arms, causing the handle to drop relative to the boat, thus blade goes deep.</td>
    <td>Keep the **handle level through the drive**, maintaining consistent pressure. The correct depth is with the waterline about halfway up the blade (top edge just covered). Cue: <em>“Don’t climb up, drive back.”</em> That reminds the athlete not to lift their torso (or shoulders) during the drive. In fact, Charlotte Hollings notes that digging is often caused by the body going up at the catch, lifting the hands and thus burying the blades too deep[10](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/). Instead, think of moving horizontally: drive straight back with the legs and keep the body on a level plane. Drills: Try the **“milking the cow” drill** (an old term) where you deliberately row with too shallow and too deep blades to feel the difference, then find the middle. Also, rowing with a suspension focus (really hang on handle) can help because if you’re truly hanging, you’re less likely to shove the handle down. Lastly, ensure you tap down cleanly at finish; if you miss the timing, blades can get stuck or go deep then pop out (“catch a crab”). Cue for finish: <em>“Release clean – hands away, blades light.”</em> Minimizing digging is also about confidence: trust that the blade **will find its depth** if you keep the handle stable and focus force straight to the bow. Let the boat/erg resistance naturally set how far the blade goes; usually half-blade depth is optimal.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><strong>Washing Out at Finish</strong> (blade comes out while still in drive)</td>
    <td>“Washing out” means the rower fails to keep the blade buried through the end of the drive – the blade comes up toward the surface before the stroke is finished, often visible as water spraying off the blade. Essentially, the rower drops the hands too early, so the latter part of the stroke has little water connection[10](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/). This wastes energy (the term comes from the blade just washing water instead of gripping). It also upsets balance as one side’s blade is not pushing water while the other might be. Common causes: pulling the handle down into the lap, lack of arm strength or fatigue (unable to finish the stroke strong), or impatience to feather. 
    </td>
    <td>**Finish level and then tap down.** In simpler terms, keep the handle drawing straight into the body at a consistent height, and only when you’ve finished the pull do you push it down to release[10](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/). Cue: <em>“Finish high, then hands down.”</em> One coaching tip: think of keeping **the bottom edge of the blade in the water until you start the feather**[10](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/). You want to see the blade half-covered even as you start to extract. Another cue is *“press through the finish”* – don’t ease off too early. Technically, ensure your elbows pull through and don’t collapse. Often washing out is linked with weak finish posture, so do exercises to strengthen the finish: e.g., high-resistance rowing or rowing with a bungee can train holding pressure to the end. Also, practice the **“pause at finish with blades in”** drill: row normally, then at the finish stop with blades still in the water, feeling that you could support your weight with the handle; then tap down. This builds confidence in keeping the blades buried. Charlotte Hollings advises that as long as the arms are pulling the handle, the blade’s bottom half should stay in the water[10](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/) – remember that. Then to release, **release pressure and feather out** in one smooth motion[10](https://www.row2k.com/features/2474/technique-feature-common-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/) (not yank down). *Cue:* **“Draw through — now release.”** This separates the draw and release steps. When corrected, you’ll see a cleaner finish with minimal splash, and the boat will feel more set (balanced) as all crews finish together correctly[8](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/the-finish-in-rowing-technique/).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Handle Grip Issues</strong> (death grip, bent wrists, etc.)</td>
    <td>Some rowers hold the handle too tight (white-knuckle “death grip”), or with wrists cocked up/down, or incorrect hand placement. A too-tight grip causes forearm fatigue, restricts fluid motion, and can lead to injuries like tendonitis. Bent wrists (not flat) can lead to inefficient force transfer and risk injury. Grips issues often show up as trouble feathering smoothly or tense shoulders. On an erg, overgripping can also show as early arm bend or wrist flicking.</td>
    <td>**Relax the grip.** Thumbs underneath the handle, fingers loosely hooked over top. Wrists should stay flat (straight) through the stroke[9](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique). Imagine your fingers as hooks and your grip as if holding a suitcase – secure but not squeezing. Cue: <em>“Relax your fingers – don’t choke it.”</em> One suggestion is to occasionally row with **open palms (feathering with fingertips)** on the recovery to test if you’re leaning on the handle or over-gripping – the handle should still sit in the fingers. Also, check hand placement: in sweep, outer hand at the end of the handle, inner hand a fist-width apart; in sculling, hands evenly spaced so thumbs almost touch at middle of handle). Drills: do a **feathering drill** where you consciously feather and square with minimal grip (just fingertips) – this enforces correct wrist motion (feather by rolling with fingers, not by twisting entire forearm). Another exercise: **tap the handle** in the palms on the recovery to remind you to loosen. Finally, stretching your forearms and shaking out hands between pieces helps reinforce a looser grip. A comfortable, loose grip will improve your finesse and fluidity (Concept2 notes a **tense grip hurts your efficiency**; keep it comfortable and wrists flat)[9](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Poor Timing in Crew</strong> (mismatch in sequencing or rhythm)</td>
    <td>In team boats (pairs, fours, eights), even if each individual has good form, the crew may be out of sync. Common timing issues: one person catches or finishes early/late, creating loping or uneven run. Or differences in stroke length (one rows shorter). Mismatched rhythm can severely hurt boat speed. Causes include lack of focus on following stroke seat, different definitions of full slide, or individual idiosyncrasies in technique (e.g., one rushes slightly). 
    </td>
    <td>**Row as one.** The stroke (leader) sets the rhythm of legs-body-arms and especially recovery speed, and everyone must consciously follow. To fix timing: often do **pause drills in team boats** (e.g., pause at finish together, then resume – helps synchronize the pick-up). Another is the **reverse pick drill by pairs**: add pairs of rowers sequentially so they must match those already rowing. Emphasize key moments: catches and finishes. Cue: <em>“Match the swing and catch together.”</em> Visually, each rower should see the person in front’s hands and seat move exactly when theirs do. The coxswain or coach can call **“together”** at catch or finish repeatedly. Also, doing drills like “Feet out” or “eyes-closed rowing” in sync can heighten collective feel. Technologically, some use metronomes or vests, but generally drills and focus work. Remember that efficiency in crews depends on everyone applying force simultaneously and recovering in harmony[5](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/). So, practice focusing not just on your motion but the boat’s movement and the rhythm of the crew. When timing improves, the boat feels smoother (less yaw or bounce) and you’ll often immediately feel an increase in speed for the same effort.</td>

The corrections above often address the root cause (e.g. sequencing, posture) which can fix multiple symptoms.

## 3. Drill Progressions from Top Programs

Rowing coaches around the world use **technical drills** to isolate parts of the stroke and reinforce correct form. Drills help athletes focus on specific elements (timing, sequence, connection) in a controlled way. Here are some **progressive drill sequences** favored by elite programs (British Rowing, USRowing, collegiate coaches) and their purposes:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Drill & Variations</th>
    <th>Purpose / Focus</th>
    <th>Execution Notes</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Pick Drill</strong> <br/>(Sequential: Arms Only → Arms + Body → 1/2 Slide → Full Slide)</td>
    <td>Builds the stroke from the finish position, emphasizing proper sequencing and adding components one at a time. Teaches rowers to generate boat speed starting with arms/back and then coordinating the leg drive.</td>
    <td>Usually done at low rates, often as a warm-up. **Start sitting at finish**: first row with <u>arms only</u> (body fixed, legs flat) – focus on clean finishes and handle speed with just arm pull. Then add <u>body swing + arms</u> (legs still flat) – now swing from hips then pull, reinforcing a strong core support and timing of body vs arms. Next, take a <u>quarter or half slide</u>: introduce a bit of leg drive, but not full – ensures the initial leg drive is connected without losing the sequencing (legs press, then swing, then arms). Finally, <u>full slide</u> strokes with all components. Each segment might be ~10 strokes then transition, or a set distance on each. By the end, the full stroke feels more unified. Coaches like this progression because it isolates then integrates. (Many U.S. college crews use this as daily drill; it’s also commonly used on ergs in training.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Reverse Pick (Russian Drill)</strong> <br/>(Legs Only → Legs+Body → Full)</td>
    <td>Trains the catch and connection by starting the stroke from just the leg drive. Emphasizes engaging legs while keeping arms straight and timing the catch correctly, then adding body swing.</td>
    <td>Opposite of pick drill: begin at the catch position. Take strokes using <u>legs only</u> (arms straight, body stays forward). The goal is to nail the catch: quick blade entry and immediate leg push with a **hang**. The drive ends when legs finish; body and arms stay forward – then recover. This drill highlights leg speed and connection (if you yank early or open back, it’s immediately apparent). After some legs-only strokes, add <u>body swing</u> (legs + body, no arm pull). Now you get to finish the stroke with back swing after the leg drive, but still no arm bend. Finally, integrate <u>full stroke</u>. This “Russian” style drill is excellent for practicing the catch and explosive leg drive. Coaches use it to ensure athletes are not hesitating at the catch and that they’re sequencing legs and body correctly. Be cautious on an erg to not hyperextend at finish since arms aren’t used initially. Typically done at moderate pressure, low rate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Pause Drills</strong> <br/>(Pause at defined points: e.g., arms-away, body-over, half-slide, or at the catch or finish)</td>
    <td>Improves awareness of body position and balance at key moments. Allows a crew to focus on *one aspect at a time* and then restart together, sharpening timing and control. Common pause points: after the finish (hands away), at mid-recovery (body over), or at full slide (just before catch).</td>
    <td>Example: **Pause at arms-away** – after each stroke, once arms are fully extended away, pause for 1-2 seconds. This reinforces sending hands smoothly away and getting the body set forward before moving up the slide. It also gives a moment to check posture. Another: **pause at half-slide** – row normally, but halt the recovery when legs are half compressed. This can train approaching the catch in a composed, controlled way (good for preventing rushing). **Catch pause**: pause momentarily right at the catch position (shins vertical) before driving – this isolates the catch placement (often used in stationary drills to practice a quick catch without rushing the slide). Similarly, **finish pause** (blades out, hands away a few inches from body) helps crews refocus on clean releases together. These drills are often done by calls – e.g., “Every 3rd stroke pause.” They force rowers to be precise and in sync. As one coach noted, *“a well-timed pause drill almost always does the trick”* for technique focus[7](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/). They should be used purposefully: the coach or cox calls the pause when the crew needs work on that phase.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Feet-Out Rowing</strong> (Strapless)</td>
    <td>Develops proper balance and posture, especially at finish and recovery. Forces rowers to be smooth because without straps they cannot rely on them to stay on the seat or to pull themselves up the slide. Enhances connection (must push against footplate through entire stroke) and encourages a controlled recovery.</td>
    <td>Remove feet from the heel straps (both on ergs and in the boat; just rest feet on top of the shoes). Row normally. Immediate effects: if the rower jerks at finish or leans back too far, their backside will tend to slip off or they’ll fall backward – so it teaches not to yank on the finish and to sit up. If the rower rushes the recovery or doesn’t stay connected, their feet will lose contact with the stretcher. As Minnesota coach Alicea Strodel says, *“we row quite a bit of feet out to keep athletes on the seat at the finish… when they can row with confidence, connection, and power feet-out, we know we’re making progress.”*[7](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/). Another coach, Luke Agnini, notes *“feet out forces the athlete to connect to the footboard… one of the most important relationships in the boat.”*[7](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/). Typically done at low to mid rates. It’s also a common check-in drill during warm-ups: many elite crews start with a few minutes strapless every practice. Remember: keep pressure through the feet especially during the finish and recovery to stay connected. On the erg, strapless rowing is an excellent teacher of a proper recovery (if you tug on foot straps to recover, strapless will quickly fix that habit)[6](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Square Blade Rowing</strong> (no feathering)</td>
    <td>Sharpens blade work and balance. By keeping blades square on the recovery, rowers must handle the oar precisely – any mistake shows up as a blade dragging on water or hitting it. Great for improving catch placement and finish timing (since no feather crutch to hide errors).</td>
    <td>Instruct the crew to row without feathering the blades at all. After the finish, instead of feathering, they keep the blade square (vertical) as they recover and then directly catch again. This is difficult: the clearance of blades over the water is minimal, so everyone must be very steady and precise. It tends to quickly teach **blades level movement** and proper hand heights. If someone normally feathers early or late, now they can’t – they must extract cleanly. Square blade rowing often reveals hidden issues: e.g., if a rower normally feathers too soon, they might catch a mini-crab now. It also requires good set (balance); crews often start by rowing square blades in calm water or by pairs/fours. Over time, it greatly refines skill. Purposefully, coaches use it to focus on catch timing – since you can clearly see if someone hesitates because their blade won’t enter smoothly. Do short bouts (e.g., 10-20 strokes square, then feather to reset). It’s challenging but effective; many top programs incorporate square blade rowing regularly as a technique tune-up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Cut-the-Cake Drill</strong></td>
    <td>Improves rhythm and swing on recovery. It involves a partial stroke that stops at a certain point and then goes back to finish, mimicking a “cut” in the stroke – often used to work on the transition of hands and body.</td>
    <td>One variant: from the finish, push the hands away and swing the body forward (like normal recovery) but **stop at mid-recovery**, then return to finish position, and then take a full stroke. This looks like: finish → hands & body away → back to finish → full stroke. The name “cut the cake” comes from that two-part motion. It helps rowers feel the separation of hands/body away before the slide. It also adds a rhythm challenge that, once mastered, can make the normal stroke feel more fluid and relaxed. A coach mentioned using Cut-the-Cake to work on “relaxation and flow on the recovery”[7](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/). It’s often done steadily (not too fast) to emphasize precision. After doing this, going back to normal strokes usually feels smoother because the rowers really organize their body motions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>One-Handed Rowing</strong> (e.g., Outboard arm only in sweep)</td>
    <td>Enhances feel for handle control and connection, especially in sweep rowing. Rowing with one arm forces the rower to stabilize and time the catch and finish properly with less muscle, and it trains the proper use of each hand in sweep (outside hand drive vs inside feather).</td>
    <td>In sweep boats, coaches sometimes have rowers row with just the outside arm (the arm at the end of the oar handle) – inside arm behind back or on the thigh. The outside arm does ~90% of the work in a proper sweep stroke, so this drill emphasizes that role[7](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/). It forces a clean catch (you cannot muscle it, you must drop and drive), and a clean release (one-handed feathering requires finesse). It also stabilizes timing: any extraneous motion is penalized. For sculling, one-handed can be done alternating arms to focus on symmetry and grip. Usually done at light pressure and by pairs/fours to keep the boat set. Marist coach Campbell Woods noted he likes *“outboard arm only on the square”* to force better feel at catch and finish[7](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/). **Inside-arm only** can also be done to teach the feather motion in sweep or to strengthen that side. In all cases, switch arms to avoid imbalance. This drill should be brief and focused due to its awkwardness, but it’s great for honing fine motor skills and connection.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>“Golf Swing” Drill</strong> (Alternate full stroke & half-pressure stroke)</td>
    <td>Builds catch timing and consistency. By alternating a regular stroke with a near-zero pressure stroke where the blade just glides through, rowers can focus on stroke mechanics without fatigue and then immediately apply them on the next stroke.</td>
    <td>This drill is likened to a golfer’s practice swing. One coach (Eric Gehrke) described: every other stroke is an **air stroke** – catch and square the blade but then let it glide with minimal pressure, as if taking a stroke with no drive[7](https://www.row2k.com/features/5181/rowing-technique-part-4-favorite-drills/). On that “air stroke,” you still go through the motions but lightly (the blade may just skim). Then the next stroke, you row normally with full pressure. Alternating like this forces concentration: you practice the placement and swing in the easy stroke, then immediately try to replicate the motion with power on the next. It helps isolate if a problem is due to power application or timing – often rowers find the easy stroke is perfectly timed, so they learn to carry that into the full stroke. It’s useful for *many facets* – catch, balance, relaxation. Called “golf swing drill” as noted, since golfers often do a practice swing. Usually done at steady rate, e.g., 20spm, alternating strokes for a few minutes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>High Rating Bursts</strong> (with focus on technique)</td>
    <td>Develops the ability to maintain technique at racing stroke rates. Short bursts at high rate (e.g., 10-20 strokes) where rowers concentrate on not letting form degrade – especially quick catches and finishes, and maintaining ratio even as rate increases.</td>
    <td>For example, after steady-state rowing at 18 spm, do a burst up to 32 spm for 20 strokes, then back down. During the burst, coaches remind: *“Keep those catches sharp, finishes together!”* The idea is to prepare for race conditions where everything speeds up. If any technical flaw appears at high rate (e.g., rush, timing loss), drill it by repeating bursts focusing on that fix. High-rate drills often come after ingraining proper form at low rates. They should be controlled – not all-out sprints for power, but quickness and precision. Many programs integrate “builds” or “rate 10s” to simulate and practice the transition. Biomechanical note: stroke length tends to shorten naturally at high rates[12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full), so practicing maintaining length and form is key. Keep the ratio (though compressed) and stay relaxed. This drill ties everything together – it’s the test of your technical foundation under pressure.</td>
  </tr>

</table>

These drills can be combined and varied infinitely. For instance, British Rowing’s **technical model** encourages using pauses and pick drill elements as needed for specific athletes’ weaknesses. **Progression** is important: start with simple drills at low intensity; as athletes improve, increase complexity (e.g., do drills at higher stroke rates or add sequences together). Many coaches advise revisiting drills regularly – even advanced rowers do pick drills or feet-out to reinforce fundamentals. A 2020 survey of collegiate coaches revealed that **pause drills and feet-out rowing** were universally popular for reinforcing fundamentals and connection.

Finally, always **know the purpose of each drill** – as one coach said, *“I educate rowers on why we are doing that drill… There is a purpose behind everything we do.”* Focusing on the drill’s goal (whether it’s timing, power application, or balance) will maximize its benefit and carryover to your normal rowing.

## 4. Biomechanical Principles for Power & Efficiency

Rowing is not just about brute force – it’s about applying force effectively over time and through the correct range of motion. Several key biomechanical principles underlie efficient rowing technique:

*   **Power = Force × Length / Time:** In rowing, the power you generate during a stroke is a function of how much force you apply to the handle/oar, over what distance (stroke length), and how quickly you complete the stroke. This means there are trade-offs: a longer stroke (more length) generally increases power, but if it’s too slow it could reduce power per unit time; higher stroke rate decreases time per stroke but often with shorter arcs or less force. The goal is to optimize all three: apply high force, through a long effective stroke, at a rating you can sustain. The British Rowing article explains that boat speed comes from rower-generated power, but *“rowing power is different from erg power – it depends on technique and how the work is applied”*. Efficient technique maximizes the *power out* (to the boat) for a given *power in* (rower effort). [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/)

*   **Effective Length (Catch and Finish Angles):** The *overall arc* of the oar (in degrees) from catch to finish contributes to length. However, not all of that arc produces force – the segments at the very beginning and end can be “missed” if the blade isn’t fully loaded. These wasted angles are **catch slip** and **finish slip**. For example, if a rower’s oar moves 5° at the catch before water resistance really kicks in, that 5° is slip. Coaches emphasize **quick catches and finishes** to minimize slip. A larger effective arc (total arc minus slip) means more water covered per stroke. Research shows that **greater catch angles** (getting the blade in further forward) and minimizing slips are associated with improved performance. Effective length can often be improved by flexibility (allowing more reach) and technique (catch timing, finishing together). However, there is a limit – overreaching can introduce other inefficiencies. The takeaway: aim for **length in the water** (literally how far your blade travels while connected) rather than just length on the slide. [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/) [\[frontiersin.org\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full), [\[frontiersin.org\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full)

*   **Connection and Force Curve:** “Connection” refers to feeling the load on the handle right after the catch and maintaining it. An ideal **force curve** (force vs. time during drive) in rowing usually rises quickly as the legs push, then maybe plateaus slightly and tails off as you finish. Elite rowers tend to have **front-loaded force curves**, meaning a lot of the force comes early from the legs. They also achieve **peak force at the right time** – approximately when the oar is around perpendicular to the boat (typically a bit before perpendicular), since that’s the most effective lever position. If you push too slowly, you might only peak late (when oar is past perpendicular, less efficient). The rate at which force is developed (RFD) is important: a study by Warmenhoven et al. 2017 found higher-performing scullers had faster force development and peaked force sooner in the drive than others. **Aim**: connect quickly at the catch and push hard so that by mid-drive you are near peak force. Also, *consistent* force application yields better efficiency – i.e., not huge spikes then drop-off. In crew rowing, similar force curves among rowers help boat run smoothly. [\[plus.briti...rowing.org\]](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/) [\[frontiersin.org\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full)

*   **Legs-Trunk-Arms Power Distribution:** As noted, the legs contribute the largest share of power. Classic figures are roughly **\~45% legs, 30-40% trunk, 15-20% arms** for on-water rowing. (One source gives 45/37/18 for legs/back/arms on-water.) On the erg, the distribution shifts slightly (legs a bit less, trunk a bit more) due to the different mechanics. The implication: technique should leverage the legs as much as possible – they’re your strongest muscles. If you find your arms or back are tiring before your legs, it likely means you are not sequencing or connecting properly. A well-timed leg drive also takes burden off the smaller muscle groups. Coaches often measure this indirectly via something like the power curve or by video analysis, to ensure the rower isn’t “missing leg drive.” [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/)

    <!-- Copilot-Researcher-Visualization -->



*   **Work per Stroke vs. Stroke Rate:** There is a trade-off between how hard/long each stroke is and how many strokes per minute (spm) you take. Initially, beginners are taught to row long and efficiently at lower rates. As one improves, **rate can increase** while maintaining a good portion of the length and power. In racing, a higher stroke rate produces more boat speed, but only if you can still apply good power each stroke. If technique deteriorates at higher rate (shortened length or poor connection), the advantage is lost. Research by Holt et al. (2020) noted that higher stroke rates and greater catch angles both had positive effects on velocity, and catch angle (length) remained important even when accounting for rate. This suggests: training to preserve technique at high rates is beneficial. It’s why **technical periodization** (discussed later) often starts with low-rate skill development, then moves to higher rates. [\[frontiersin.org\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full), [\[frontiersin.org\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full)

*   **Hull Speed and Recovery Dynamics:** On-water, remember that when you’re on recovery, the boat is still moving. Good technique minimizes how much the rower’s movements slow the boat. If you **rush the slide** or make abrupt motions, the **hull decelerates** more each stroke (wasting energy). Studies with acceleration sensors show a pronounced dip in speed if recovery is poor. By contrast, a smooth recovery (hands away, controlled slide) leads to a smaller check and thus higher overall speed for the same power. This is part of rowing efficiency: not just how hard you pull, but how little you slow the boat in between. Biomechanically, it’s about moving your body mass in sync with the boat’s motion. There is a concept of the rower-boat system: if the rower returns more slowly, the boat can actually glide more (since less force is opposing forward motion). This again highlights the importance of ratio and timing on recovery.

*   **Balance & Symmetry:** Efficiency also requires minimal wasted motion like unnecessary boat roll or yaw. Technical faults like uneven finishes or inconsistent side-to-side pressure can cause the boat to **yaw (veer)** or **roll (tilt)**. This too costs energy because rowers then waste effort correcting balance instead of propelling forward. For scullers, symmetry in force application between both oars is key; for sweep, the crew must balance each side’s force. The biomechanics here involve handle force patterns – ideally similar on port and starboard. Tools like force gates and oarlock sensors help measure this. The practical tip is to make sure you’re pulling through evenly and together with your crewmates. Good synchronization of movements (as mentioned, *“moving as one”* in a crew) means forces are aligned and the boat is propelled straight and efficiently.

*   **Injury Prevention Biomechanics:** Efficient technique is also safer. For instance, if one rows with a strong core and avoids over-compression and over-layback, the **lumbar spine stays safer**. The ergometer differences (next section) highlight that poor technique (like too much layback or jerky motions) increases injury risk. Efficient motions – smooth force curves, proper sequencing – distribute load in a healthier way. From a biomechanical standpoint, the sequencing (legs, body, arms) not only is powerful but also **spreads the work** across muscle groups, preventing any one area (like the lower back or arms) from taking excessive strain.

In summary, rowing efficiently means **applying your strength at the right times and places**: connect early at the catch, use legs predominantly, carry the speed through a long stroke, and recover in a way that conserves momentum. Data from instrumentation and research reinforce classic technique pointers: for example, a study in *Frontiers in Sports* (Holt et al. 2020) confirmed that crews with **larger catch angles, higher mean force, and quicker force development** went faster, especially after adjusting for power and rate. This validates the idea that *how* you row (technically) can distinguish two rowers with the same power. A smaller athlete with excellent technique can outpace a stronger athlete with poor efficiency.

Therefore, mastering these biomechanical principles through drills and mindful practice is critical for any rower aiming to maximize boat speed.

## 5. Ergometer vs. On-Water Technique Differences

**Indoor rowing machines (ergometers)** simulate the rowing stroke, but there are important differences in mechanics and feel compared to **on-water rowing**. Understanding these differences will help you adapt your technique appropriately:

*   **Resistance and Force Curve:** On the water, the resistance comes from dragging the oar through water, which has some “give” at the catch until the blade locks. On an air resistance erg (like the Concept2), the resistance is from a flywheel – you feel a more immediate pickup. This leads to subtle differences: **ergometer strokes often have a slightly later peak force** and can encourage longer strokes. In fact, biomechanical analysis shows **erg strokes tend to have a higher peak force that occurs later in the drive** than on water. On water, a well-connected catch might produce a lower, earlier peak (because too much force too early slips the blade). On the erg, if you hammer the catch, the flywheel obliges and you might see a big peak after you overcome its inertia. So, while you still aim for legs-first, you might notice the force curve shape differ. Just be aware not to develop an overly jerky drive on the erg – carry over the idea of a smooth acceleration as if you were in a boat. [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/)

*   **Stroke Length:** Studies have found the stroke on an erg can be **2-5% longer in distance** than on-water rowing. Without the boat’s constraints (fin, water drag at extremes of reach), rowers often reach a bit farther at both catch and finish on the erg. Also, there’s no fear of catching a crab or overbalancing, so ergers might lay back more or compress more. While a bit of extra length is fine, one must be cautious: overdoing it can instill habits like over-compression or excessive layback that might not translate well to the boat (and could risk injury on the erg). So, row **with the same reference points**: shins vertical at catch, a strong but not extreme layback at finish. [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/)

*   **Balance and Stabilization:** In a boat, athletes must continuously balance, which engages small stabilizer muscles and requires fine movements (especially with the oar handles for balance). On an erg, balance is a non-factor – the machine is stable. This means erg users can sometimes get away with sloppy motions that would flip a single scull. For example, on the erg you might lean to one side or not notice uneven pressure. On water, you’d feel the boat tilt. **Thus, erg technique should be done consciously symmetrically.** Pay attention to handle path (straight line), posture (no leaning), and apply power evenly with both legs. Some rowers use a mirror or side video to catch asymmetries on the erg that they wouldn’t catch by feel.

*   **Foot Connection and Finish on the Erg:** Because your feet are strapped on the erg, some rowers **tug against the straps at finish**, using them to stop their body and to pull themselves up on recovery. This is a bad habit – on water, you can’t do that (shoes allow some heel lift but you’re not strapped as tightly). As noted earlier, strapless erg rowing is a great teacher here. Also, the **dynamic of the erg finish**: on water, as you finish, the boat is moving under you, so there’s a sense of letting the boat glide as you release. On a static erg, you finish and immediately have to recover up a stationary rail – less boat run to feel. Mentally, try to mimic that boat feel: after the finish, **imagine the “boat” (flywheel) still wants to run**, so be patient with the hands and recovery.

*   **Force Distribution (Legs/Back/Arms):** Remarkably, research shows a slightly different distribution on ergs: one source found on the erg the trunk (back) contributes relatively more (41% vs 37%) and legs slightly less (37% vs 45%) compared to on-water. This may be because on the erg, once the flywheel is spinning, maintaining leg pressure is a bit different and people might rely on trunk swing to keep the power on. Also the lack of instability might let rowers lay back a bit more and use more back muscle work. **Implication:** On the erg, be mindful not to under-use your legs. Really focus on maintaining leg drive pressure to avoid shifting load to the back too much. (The cited analysis by Ivan Hooper warns that the greater trunk involvement on ergs could contribute to more back strain and fatigue if one isn’t careful.) [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/) [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/), [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/)

*   **Physical Feedback:** On water, you get immediate feedback from the boat (if you rush, you feel check; if you miss water, you feel light pressure; if you wash out, boat may roll). The erg is more forgiving and also more monotonous feedback – mostly the pace number and maybe the sound of the flywheel. Because of this, erging can allow bad habits to go unchecked. **Use metrics** (like the force curve display on some ergs or a coach’s eye) to catch issues. For instance, Concept2 monitors can show force curve – if yours is very peaked or very asymmetrical, that might hint at a technique issue to fix for on-water.

*   **Cox or Coach vs. Self:** In a boat, often a coxswain or coach is actively giving technical calls. On an erg (especially if training alone), you must be your own coach. It’s easy to fall into just grinding for split. So, mentally cue yourself and even periodically film your erg technique to compare with your on-water form.

*   **Injuries – Erg Cautions:** The erg, being on a fixed rail, can encourage overuse patterns. Hooper (Rowing Aust.) noted that prolonged erg rowing led to increased lumbar motion and fatigue, contributing to back pain. Also, many rowers report the erg is tougher on the backside (no swinging boat) and on hamstrings. To mitigate this, make sure you **use proper posture** (sit tall, hinge at hips, engage core) and don’t overly slump at the finish. Take stretch breaks and ensure your erg is on a level surface at correct drag factor. On-water rowing provides variation and micro-adjustments each stroke; the erg is repetitive, so good form is crucial to avoid injury. [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/), [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/)

*   **Boat-Specific Skills Missing on Erg:** On erg you don’t feather or square an oar, and you don’t steer. So remember to practice those off the erg. Also, the timing of the rower vs. boat acceleration is a feel that isn’t present on the erg. If you only erg for a long period, first few rows on water require re-adjusting to things like recovery timing with boat run, and the need to tap down/feather. Ergo, try to incorporate indoor rowing that mimics some aspects (slides or dynamic ergs that move can help replicate on-water feel a bit, or pausing drills to simulate catches, etc.).

**Adapting Cues:** Some technique cues shift focus slightly between erg and water. For example:

*   On water, coaches say *“send the boat”* or *“let it run”* on the recovery – on the erg you might say *“feel the flywheel spin”* or *“maintain momentum”*.
*   On water, *“keep the shell level”* – on erg: *“symmetrical pressure”* or use mirror to ensure even handle heights.
*   On water, *“quick catches, no misses”* – on erg: *“quick engagement”* (you won’t miss water, but you can miss connecting with the flywheel if you’re sloppy).
*   On water, *“tap down clean”* – on erg, this translates to simply *“hands away smoothly”* (since there’s no actual water release, but you still want a smooth turnaround at finish).

Despite differences, **good rowing is good rowing.** The fundamental positions and sequences **do not change** between erg and boat. Many top erg scores come from technically proficient on-water athletes, not just gym brute strength, demonstrating that efficiency matters on the erg too. If anything, treat the erg as a training tool to **refine your stroke** in a stable environment (focus on posture, sequencing, power per stroke) and then translate that improved strength and skill back to the boat. [\[rowperfect.co.uk\]](https://www.rowperfect.co.uk/kinetics-and-kinematics-of-ergometer-against-on-water-rowing/)

*(Interesting fact: A 2011 study by Greene et al. compared ergometer types and on-water rowing – they found differences in kinematics but also noted that modern dynamic ergs can more closely replicate on-water movements).*

In summary, adjust for the erg’s characteristics (no balance, different drag) by being extra mindful of technique, and conversely adjust on water by re-incorporating boat feel (set, handle heights, blade work). Many rowing machines, like the Concept2, are designed to approximate the rowing stroke as *“natural motion”* as possible, so use that to your advantage but remain cognizant of the subtleties above.

## 6. Technical Focus by Skill Level (Periodization of Technique)

Rowing technique development is a **gradual, long-term process**. Beginners, intermediates, and advanced rowers should focus on different technical elements appropriate to their skill and athletic development. This concept is sometimes called **technical periodization** – as rowers progress, certain basics become second-nature and new, finer points take priority. Below is a guideline for technical focus at each stage: [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke), [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)

<table>
<thead>
  <tr><th>Level</th><th>Primary Technical Focus</th><th>Description & Key Cues</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Beginner</strong> (<em>Learn-to-Row, Rough Coordination</em>)</td>
    <td>**Sequencing & Fundamentals**: Establish the correct order of the stroke (arms-body-legs recovery, legs-body-arms drive) and basic positions. Safety and consistency are crucial – e.g., developing a solid catch position and finish position. Also balance basics and boat handling (if on water).</td>
    <td>New rowers must first learn **what the stroke should feel like**. Initial focus goes to *posture* (sit tall, core engaged) and *sequencing*. Drills like the Pick Drill are heavily used to teach parts of the stroke. Cues: <em>“legs then body then arms”</em> on drives, and <em>“hands away, then body”</em> on recovery, are repeated constantly[1](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2022/10/24/common-errors-and-how-to-correct-them/). Another fundamental is learning to pull **with both hands evenly** (in sweep, learning to feather, etc.) and keeping blades off the water on recovery. At this stage, ***length is secondary to control*** – coaches often shorten the stroke (half slide rowing) until the athlete can handle full slide without losing form[2](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke). Pressure is low; the mantra is technique first, power later[2](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke). Beginners also need to develop *rhythm at steady slow rates* (e.g., 18-20spm) before worrying about higher stroke rates. **Key outcomes for a novice**: they can row continuous full strokes with a reasonably consistent rhythm and no major sequencing errors. They should also grasp concepts like “ratio” and not rushing. It’s normal for rough coordination in this phase – the aim is to make the basic stroke pattern automatic through lots of steady practice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Intermediate</strong> (<em>Refinement, Smooth Coordination</em>)</td>
    <td>**Efficiency & Add Power**: Refine the stroke for more run and consistency. Emphasize *ratio (control on recovery)*, smoother catches/finishes, and begin to apply more power per stroke while maintaining form. Work on lengthening the stroke and improving timing within a crew. Start translating technique to racing situations (higher rates).</td>
    <td>By this stage, the basics are in muscle memory; now the rower can concentrate on **making each stroke effective and economical**. One big focus is improving the **drive power**: developing a stronger leg drive and trunk swing while still sequencing correctly. They work on *compression flexibility* to reach a longer catch (if they were conservative as beginners) and *full use of the slide*. Ratio work is important: <em>“longer recovery, sharper drive”</em> to maximize boat run[9](https://www.concept2.com/training/improve-your-rowing-technique). Intermediates often revisit drills like feet-out (to ensure they’re not relying on straps as they increase power) or pause drills to fine-tune timing. **Common goals**: making catches quicker and more direct (no digging or missing water) and making finishes cleaner (no rush out or late feathers). They also start doing more work at moderate ratings (e.g., 24-28) to learn to maintain technique at speed. Concepts of **boat feel** and self-correction emerge – rowers can sense when they rush or when timing is off. Technical training might involve more complex drills or combining drills (e.g., rate ladders with pauses). In periodization terms, this is the “smooth coordination” phase where elements learned are being refined and put together under varying conditions[2](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke). The intermediate rower’s stroke should now look consistent and fluid even as they add pressure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Advanced</strong> (<em>Stabilization & Precision</em>)</td>
    <td>**Fine-Tuning & Consistency Under Pressure**: Perfecting blade work (minimal slip, maximal effective length), maintaining technique at race rates and fatigue, and making technique adjustments to individual physiology (rigging tweaks, personal style within fundamentals). Crew synchronization and **technical resilience** (holding form in rough water, under sprint conditions) are key.</td>
    <td>Advanced athletes focus on the last few percentages of efficiency. They seek to **minimize any waste**: for example, working on <u>reducing catch and finish slips</u> to near zero[5](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/), achieving uniform force curves stroke to stroke, and eliminating micro-faults (like a slight check on recovery or a tiny late feather). At this level, rowers use tools like telemetry: they may analyze their <strong>force curve</strong> or seat acceleration graph to spot where they can gain speed. For instance, they might adjust how quickly they engage the legs or how they apply foot pressure to shape the ideal force curve[5](https://plus.britishrowing.org/2024/03/25/unlocking-speed-the-role-of-biomechanics-in-efficient-rowing/). Crew boats at advanced level spend time on <strong>synchronization drills</strong> – rowing with eyes closed to fine-tune feel, or using rate builders to practice catches in unison at 36+ spm. They also do a lot of <strong>race-pace pieces</strong> where holding technique is the goal. A phrase for advanced rowing is *“technical discipline”* – doing it right every stroke, even when tired or in wind. Coaches might introduce minor technical modifications if needed (e.g., adjusting span or foot stretchers to optimize arc, trying slight variations in catch angle to see speed differences – advanced rowers can handle these tweaks). Essentially, this phase is about **consistency and optimizing**. The movements have been stabilized to the point they are automatic and robust under stress[2](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)[2](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke). When an elite rower crosses the 2000m finish, their form might still look as solid as at the start – that’s the level of ingrained technique aimed for. Advanced crews also refine *collective technique* – everyone matching perfectly to maximize the combined effectiveness (sometimes measured by low intra-crew variability in metrics)[12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full)[12](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2020.589013/full). In sum, advanced technical focus is on the details: blade depth, handle speed consistency, perfectly timing the drive acceleration with boat dynamics, etc., all while pushing maximum power.</td>

</table>

This progression often aligns with **experience, but not strictly time** – an adult beginner might take a year to reach intermediate skills, whereas a youth might advance faster with daily practice. Also, rowers might revisit “beginner” focuses at times (for example, an advanced rower who picked up a bad habit might go back to basic drills to fix it). It’s a continuous cycle of reinforcement.

A structured approach is advocated by bodies like World Rowing’s coaching education: they describe phases like *“Rough coordination → Smooth coordination → Fine coordination (stabilization)”* which map to our Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced focuses. Essentially, you **learn it**, then you **refine it**, then you **nail it under all conditions**. [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke), [\[usrowing.org\]](https://usrowing.org/learn-about-rowing/overview/the-stroke)

**Technical Periodization in Practice:** Coaches will often emphasize different points in a season. For example, in winter (base training), even an advanced crew might spend lots of time at low rates reinforcing technique fundamentals (like steady-state rows focusing on stroke length and consistency). As racing season approaches, the focus shifts to applying that technique at high rates and under race fatigue. But if something regresses, they’ll drop back down to drills. This dynamic approach ensures continuous technical improvement.

**Conclusion:** No matter the level, the core principles of good technique remain the same. What changes is where athletes put their mental energy. Beginners might think “legs, then body, then arms” every stroke; advanced rowers do it automatically and might think about more nuanced things like pressure on the toes vs. heels or the exact timing of weight transfer. At all levels, **feedback and deliberate practice** are key – use video, coaching, and self-awareness to progress to the next stage. With time and practice, a rower’s stroke becomes not only more powerful but also more efficient and artful.
