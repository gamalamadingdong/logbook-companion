# Rowing Technique Guide: Optimized Summary

## 1. Optimal Stroke Mechanics & Sequencing

### The Four Phases: Catch → Drive → Finish → Recovery

**Catch**
- Body: Compressed forward, shins vertical, hips flexed, shoulders forward of hips, arms extended, back straight (1 o'clock lean)
- Blade Entry: Quick squared blade placed just before leg drive, minimal catch slip
- Timing: No pause between recovery and drive; blade and legs connect simultaneously
- Cues: *"Quick catch, then leg drive"*, *"Heels down"*

**Drive (Legs → Body → Arms)**
- **Legs First**: Drive with legs while torso stays forward, arms straight (hang off handle)
- **Body Swing**: After legs 75-90% extended, hips open and torso swings back (1 o'clock → 11 o'clock)
- **Arm Pull**: Final 10%, arms draw handle to lower ribs after back swing
- Power: Front-loaded force curve, peak force early (oar ~15-20° past catch)
- Cues: *"Legs–Body–Arms"*, *"Push don't pull"*, *"Hang off the handle"*

**Finish**
- Body: Legs flat, layback ~15° past vertical, arms bent, handle at lower ribs, elbows out
- Blade Exit: Tap down to extract blade square, then feather once clear of water
- Connection: Maintain pressure through finish, legs down, core braced
- Cues: *"Tap down, then feather"*, *"Finish strong through the handle"*

**Recovery (Arms → Body → Legs)**
- **Hands Away**: Immediately after finish, hands move away from body smoothly
- **Body Forward**: Torso pivots forward from hips (11 o'clock lean)
- **Slide Forward**: Only after arms/body set, knees bend and seat moves forward
- Ratio: Recovery ~2× longer than drive time (2:1 ratio)
- Timing: Controlled, no rushing; let boat run
- Cues: *"Arms–Body–Legs"*, *"Slow up the slide"*, *"Let it run"*

## 2. Common Technical Faults & Corrections

| Fault | Symptoms/Causes | Correction & Cues |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Early Arm Pull** | Arms bend at drive start, reducing leg power transfer | Keep arms straight during leg drive. Cue: *"Push first, pull last"*. Drill: Legs-only rowing |
| **Early Body Opening / Shooting the Slide** | Back opens before leg drive complete, or seat flies back without handle movement | Engage core, keep body forward until legs finish. Cue: *"Legs down, brace and push"*. Drill: Pause at half-drive |
| **Rushing the Slide** | Fast recovery, poor 2:1 ratio, jerky strokes, boat check | Slow recovery, count "1 (drive), 2-3 (recovery)". Cue: *"Let it run"*. Drill: Pause drills, feet-out rowing |
| **Bending Knees Too Early** | Knees break before hands/body clear, hands collide with knees | Hands away, body over, *then* slide. Cue: *"Hands and body first – legs wait"*. Drill: Arms-and-body only |
| **Over-Compression at Catch** | Shins past vertical, back rounded, seat hits heels, weak catch position | Shins vertical or slightly less; find tension at catch. Cue: *"Triangle of air"* between calf/thigh. Drill: Strapless rowing, slide stopper |
| **Skying the Blade** | Blade too high before catch, then plunges down, losing length | Carry hands level into catch, raise blade only as you place it. Cue: *"Level hands into the front"*. Drill: Square blade rowing, backsplash drill |
| **Digging/Diving the Blade** | Blade too deep (shaft submerged), wastes energy moving water | Keep handle level through drive, don't lift body. Cue: *"Don't climb up, drive back"*. Optimal depth: waterline halfway up blade |
| **Washing Out at Finish** | Blade comes out before drive complete, loses connection | Finish level, then tap down. Keep blade bottom edge in water until release. Cue: *"Finish high, then hands down"*. Drill: Pause at finish with blades in |
| **Handle Grip Issues** | Death grip, bent wrists, forearm fatigue | Relax grip, thumbs under handle, wrists flat. Cue: *"Relax your fingers"*. Drill: Feathering with fingertips only |
| **Poor Timing in Crew** | Catches/finishes mismatched, uneven stroke length, loping boat run | Match stroke seat rhythm, synchronize catches/finishes. Cue: *"Together at the catch"*. Drill: Pause drills, reverse pick drill by pairs |

## 3. Drill Progressions

| Drill | Purpose | Execution |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Pick Drill** (Arms → Arms+Body → 1/2 Slide → Full) | Builds stroke sequentially, teaches proper component addition | Start at finish: arms only → add body swing → add half leg drive → full stroke. Low rate warm-up |
| **Reverse Pick / Russian** (Legs → Legs+Body → Full) | Trains catch/connection, emphasizes legs-first with straight arms | Start at catch: legs only (arms straight, body forward) → add body swing → full stroke |
| **Pause Drills** (at arms-away, body-over, half-slide, catch, finish) | Improves position awareness, timing, control | Pause at defined points (1-2 sec), check posture, restart together. Forces precision |
| **Feet-Out Rowing** (Strapless) | Develops balance, connection, controlled recovery | Remove feet from straps. Forces smooth finish (no pulling on straps), connected recovery |
| **Square Blade Rowing** | Sharpens blade work, balance, catch/finish timing | Row without feathering. Blade stays square on recovery. Reveals timing/balance errors |
| **Cut-the-Cake** | Improves rhythm, hand/body transition | From finish: hands/body away → back to finish → full stroke. Emphasizes recovery flow |
| **One-Handed Rowing** | Enhances handle control, connection (especially sweep outside arm) | Row with one arm (outside in sweep). Forces clean catch/finish, builds finesse |
| **Golf Swing** (Alternate full/air strokes) | Builds catch timing consistency | Alternate normal stroke with near-zero pressure "air stroke". Practice form, then apply |
| **High Rating Bursts** | Maintains technique at race rates | Short bursts (10-20 strokes) at high rate (32+ spm) focusing on sharp catches, ratio |

## 4. Biomechanical Principles

- **Power = Force × Length / Time**: Optimize force application, effective stroke length, and sustainable rating
- **Effective Length**: Maximize oar arc in water, minimize catch/finish slip (quick catches/finishes)
- **Connection & Force Curve**: Front-loaded force (high early with legs), peak force ~15-20° past catch, consistent pressure through drive
- **Power Distribution**: Legs ~45%, Trunk ~37%, Arms ~18% (on-water). Use legs maximally, back adds, arms finish
- **Stroke Rate vs. Work/Stroke**: Balance longer strokes (more power/stroke) with higher rate. Preserve length at higher rates
- **Ratio**: 2:1 recovery:drive minimizes boat check, allows boat run, aids recovery
- **Balance & Symmetry**: Even force application (port/starboard), synchronized movements, minimal boat yaw/roll

## 5. Ergometer vs. On-Water Differences

| Aspect | Erg | On-Water | Adaptation |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|
| **Resistance** | Flywheel (immediate pickup) | Water drag (some give at catch) | Erg: force curve peaks later. Maintain smooth acceleration |
| **Stroke Length** | 2-5% longer possible | Constrained by boat/balance | Erg: maintain same reference points (shins vertical, moderate layback) |
| **Balance** | Stable, no balance needed | Continuous balance required | Erg: consciously maintain symmetry, use mirror to check |
| **Foot Connection** | Strapped in (can tug on straps) | Less strap reliance | Erg: avoid pulling on straps. Use strapless rowing to train |
| **Power Distribution** | Trunk 41%, Legs 37%, Arms 22% | Trunk 37%, Legs 45%, Arms 18% | Erg: focus on maintaining leg drive pressure, don't over-rely on back |
| **Feedback** | Pace/force curve display | Boat feel (run, check, balance) | Erg: use metrics/video. Self-coach technique |
| **Blade Work** | None (no feathering/squaring) | Essential skill | Practice blade work on water, technique drills off-erg |

**Key Takeaway**: Good rowing is good rowing. Fundamentals don't change, but be mindful of erg-specific adaptations and translate skills between platforms.

## 6. Technical Focus by Skill Level

| Level | Primary Focus | Description & Goals |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Beginner** | Sequencing & Fundamentals | Learn stroke order (legs-body-arms drive, arms-body-legs recovery), basic positions, posture, rhythm at 18-20 spm. Low pressure, technique first. Goal: Consistent rhythm, no major sequencing errors |
| **Intermediate** | Efficiency & Add Power | Refine ratio, smoother catches/finishes, apply more power while maintaining form. Lengthen stroke, improve timing in crew, practice at 24-28 spm. Goal: Fluid, consistent stroke with increased power |
| **Advanced** | Precision & Consistency Under Pressure | Minimize catch/finish slip, uniform force curves, technique at race rates/fatigue, crew synchronization. Use telemetry, race-pace pieces. Goal: Stable, optimal technique under all conditions (36+ spm, fatigue, rough water) |

**Progression**: Learn it (rough coordination) → Refine it (smooth coordination) → Nail it under all conditions (stabilization)

## 7. Key Coaching Cues Summary
