- **Key challenge**: Get everyone to a baseline technique level, build race fitness, and prepare them mentally for their first competition — all in 11 weeks.

### Practice Schedule Assumption
- 5 days/week (Mon–Fri), ~90 min sessions
- Adjust as needed for weather, facility, school schedule
- Saturday practices optional (race sims, team building)

## Coaching Philosophy & Communication

### Philosophy: "Technique → Confidence → Speed"

Speed is the *result* of good technique and smart training, not the goal of every practice. We build the foundation first, and the speed follows. For kids who've never raced, **confidence is the most important thing we can give them before May 2nd.**

### Key Messages for Athletes
> 1. **"We're building rowers, not just racing."** Every practice makes you better. Trust the process.
> 2. **"Technique is your superpower."** The crew that rows together, cleanly, beats the crew with one fast kid rowing ugly.
> 3. **"Hard work is a team sport."** When it hurts in a race, your crewmates are hurting too. You don't quit on each other.
> 4. **"Your first race will be scary and awesome."** Everyone's nervous. That's normal. We'll be ready.

### Key Messages for Parents
> 1. **Progress over results.** Their son's first racing season is about learning, not winning. Improvement is the metric.
> 2. **Consistency matters most.** Missing practice hurts the whole crew. Please prioritize attendance.
> 3. **Nutrition & sleep are training.** 8+ hours of sleep, good breakfast, water bottle every practice. No energy drinks.
> 4. **Let the coach coach.** After a race, ask "Did you have fun? What did you learn?" not "Why didn't you win?"
> 5. **Injury communication is critical.** If your son mentions pain (especially back, ribs, knees), tell us immediately. We'd rather modify training for a week than lose him for a month.

### Parent Communication Schedule
| When | What | Format |
|------|------|--------|
| Week 1 (Feb 17) | Season kickoff letter: philosophy, schedule, expectations, gear list | Email |
| Week 3 (Mar 3) | Progress update: what we've been working on, what's next | Email |
| Week 5 (Mar 17) | Boat selection & lineup philosophy explanation | Email |
| Week 8 (Apr 6) | Race prep info: schedule, logistics, what to expect at a regatta | Email |
| Week 10 (Apr 20) | States preview: schedule, travel, race day expectations | Email + meeting |

## Boat Selection Philosophy

### Guiding Principles
1. **The fastest boat is the one that rows best together** — not necessarily the 4 fastest erg scores in a quad.
2. **Timing and blade work trump raw power** at the novice level. A technically clean crew will beat a strong but sloppy crew.
3. **Everyone races.** Every kid who commits to the season gets a seat. We may have A and B boats, but both race.
4. **Seat racing is fair and transparent.** When we do selection pieces, everyone knows what we're measuring and why.

### Selection Process (Timeline)
| When | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Weeks 1–3 | Rotate everyone through all seats/boats | See who moves well, who pairs well, who leads |
| Week 4 | First erg benchmark (NOT a 2k — see below) | Baseline fitness data |
| Weeks 4–6 | Seat racing pieces (short on-water or erg) | Head-to-head comparison in context |
| Week 6 | Preliminary lineups announced | Give crews time to gel (6 weeks to States) |
| Weeks 7–9 | Crew-specific training, minor adjustments only | Build crew chemistry and confidence |
| Week 10 | Final lineup confirmed | No changes unless injury |

### Erg Testing for 8th Graders
**DO NOT start with a 2k test.** These kids aren't ready for that physically or mentally.

| Week | Test | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Week 4 | **4 × 500m** (2 min rest) | Short enough to not be terrifying, reveals fitness + pacing ability |
| Week 7 | **2 × 1000m** (3 min rest) | Builds toward race distance, teaches pacing a longer piece |
| Week 9 | **1500m time trial** (race distance) | Full race simulation on erg, confidence builder |

### Boat Types (Adjust to Your Fleet)
For novice 8th grade boys, prioritize stability:
- **Ideal starting boat**: 4x+ (coxed quad) or 8+ — most stable, coach can communicate via cox
- **As skills develop**: 4x (quad without cox), 2x (double), possibly 1x for experienced fall rowers
- **Race entries for States**: Enter the most stable, practiced lineup. If you have enough for an 8+, that's often the best novice boat (stable, team experience, exciting).

## Appendix D: Parent Communication Templates

### Email #1 — Season Kickoff (Week 1, Feb 17)
**Subject: Welcome to Spring Rowing 2026! 🚣**

Dear Parents,

Welcome to the spring rowing season! We're excited to work with your sons over the next 11 weeks as we prepare for the Virginia State Championships on May 2nd.

**Our Philosophy**: We believe in building rowers, not just racers. We'll spend the first few weeks focused on proper technique and team culture before ramping up training intensity. Your son will learn a lifelong sport, develop fitness, discipline, and teamwork.

**Schedule**: Practice is Mon–Fri, [TIME]. Consistent attendance is critical — rowing is a team sport and missing practice affects crewmates.

**What They Need**: Water bottle, athletic clothes, positive attitude. [Add specific gear requirements.]

**What You Can Do**:
- Prioritize practice attendance
- Ensure they eat well and sleep 8+ hours
- If they mention pain (back, ribs, knees), please let us know immediately
- Ask "What did you learn today?" not "How fast did you go?"

Looking forward to a great season!

[Coach Name]

### Email #3 — Boat Selection Philosophy (Week 5, Mar 17)
**Subject: How We Select Crews 🚣**

Dear Parents,

As we enter the middle of our season, I want to explain how we'll be selecting race lineups.

**What we look at:**
1. **Technique quality** — clean strokes move boats faster than strong but sloppy ones
2. **Crew compatibility** — some athletes row better together (timing, rhythm, size match)
3. **Fitness & erg scores** — one factor among many, not the only factor
4. **Attitude & commitment** — attendance, effort, coachability

**What this means:**
- The fastest individual erg score doesn't guarantee a seat in the top boat
- Every athlete who has committed to the season WILL race
- Lineups will be set by [date] to give crews time to develop chemistry
- Minor adjustments may happen, but we avoid last-minute changes

**How to support your son:**
- Trust the process — we've seen hundreds of lineups and know what makes boats fast
- Avoid comparing your son's boat assignment to others
- Encourage him regardless of which crew he's in — every crew at States is a big deal

Thank you for your support!
