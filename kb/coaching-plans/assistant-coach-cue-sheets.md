# Assistant Coach Cue Sheets — Novice 8th Boys, Spring 2026

> **How to use this document**: Each week has ONE primary technical focus and ONE key cue. Your job as an assistant coach is to watch your section of the boat (bow 4 or stern 4) and correct for THAT ONE THING. Don't try to fix everything — fix the focus of the day. If you see something dangerous (safety issue, pain), address it immediately regardless.

---

## General Guidelines

### Your Role
- You own a section of the boat (bow 4 or stern 4). Watch those athletes.
- Focus on **one thing per day** (listed below). Don't overwhelm kids with corrections.
- Use **positive framing**: *"Try keeping your legs flat until your body is over"* not *"Stop bending your knees early."*
- When correcting, use the athlete's **seat number**: *"3-seat, hold your body over a beat longer."*
- If an athlete does it right, **say so**: *"Nice body-over, 5-seat. Just like that."*

### Pre-Launch Ritual (Every Day)
1. Help athletes carry and launch the boat safely
2. Once seated, call: *"Show me body over"* — everyone sits at body-over position
3. Walk the dock and check: Arms straight? Body hinged forward? Legs flat? Chest up?
4. Quick correction if needed, then launch

### What "Good" Looks Like

**Body Over** (the foundation — Weeks 1–2 primary focus):
- Arms fully extended toward the stern
- Body hinged forward from the hips (~11 o'clock angle)
- Back flat, chest up (not slouched)
- **Legs completely flat** — knees NOT bent yet
- This is the recovery position BEFORE the slide begins

**Timing** (Weeks 2–3 primary focus):
- All 8 bodies go over at the same time
- All 8 catches happen at the same time (one splash, not eight)
- Recovery is controlled — no one is rushing ahead of stroke seat
- The "wave" travels from bow to stern: bow pair sets the recovery speed

**Blade Work** (Weeks 3–4 primary focus):
- Blade enters the water quickly at the catch — no hesitation, no "sky" (blade going too high)
- Blade comes out cleanly at the finish — tap down, then feather
- Hands travel at a consistent height on recovery (no dipping or rising)

## Week 1 — "Body Over" (Feb 17–21)

### The One Thing
**Legs stay flat until body is over.** That's it. If the body-over position is right, everything else follows.

### Daily Focus

| Day | Activity | Watch For | Key Cue |
|-----|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Mon** | On-water: first rows, arms + body drill | Body hinging from hips, legs staying flat | *"Body over BEFORE your knees bend"* |
| **Tue** | Erg: pick drill, pause-at-body-over | Same thing on erg — legs flat at body-over pause | *"This is home. Memorize this position."* |
| **Wed** | Land training + erg | Body-over posture on erg, mirror check | *"Slow up the slide — body sets FIRST"* |
| **Thu** | On-water: pause-at-body-over in 8+ | Body position during pauses, legs flat | *"Bow 4 / Stern 4, I need your bodies over BEFORE I see knees"* |
| **Fri** | Erg games | Look for body-over in "Freeze Frame" game | *"Show me perfect body-over — NOW"* |

### Common Faults This Week & How to Fix

| What You'll See | What to Say | What's Actually Wrong |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Knees bending as soon as hands leave the body | *"Hands away, body over, THEN knees"* | Legs breaking too early — classic novice fault |
| Back slouching at body-over | *"Chest up, hinge from the hips"* | Weak core or poor hip flexibility — just cue posture |
| Rushing through body-over to get to the catch | *"Slow down. Let your body SET before you slide"* | Impatience — the low rate (16 spm) will help |
| Arms bending during the recovery | *"Straight arms all the way to body-over"* | Pulling themselves forward — cue relaxed arms |

---

## Week 2 — "Together" (Feb 24–28)

### The One Thing
**Body over at the same time. Recovery controlled from bow.** Individual body-over is now expected — the new challenge is doing it IN SYNC.

### What Carries Forward
- Body-over discipline. If someone's legs are breaking early, correct it. But your PRIMARY focus is now timing.

### Daily Focus

| Day | Activity | Watch For | Key Cue |
|-----|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Mon** | On-water: build by pairs | Each pair matching body-over timing | *"Your body goes over when THEIR body goes over"* |
| **Tue** | Erg: synced crew rowing | Groups of 4 matching rhythm | *"Watch their handle. Match their body."* |
| **Wed** | Land training + erg | Body-over maintained in longer erg pieces | *"It doesn't get sloppy because you're tired"* |
| **Thu** | On-water: cut-the-cake, feet-out | Timing at body-over, feel with feet-out | *"One splash at the catch, not eight"* |
| **Fri** | Erg games | Synced pairs scoring, rate ladder | *"Same rhythm. Same timing."* |

### Common Faults This Week & How to Fix

| What You'll See | What to Say | What's Actually Wrong |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| One rower ahead of the crew on recovery | *"[Seat], wait for stroke. Don't get ahead."* | Rushing — not following stroke seat's rhythm |
| Catch timing is off (blades hitting water at different times) | *"Listen for one splash. Right now I hear two."* | Body-over timing mismatch → catch timing mismatch |
| Bow pair and stern pair at different speeds | *"Bow pair, control the recovery. Everyone follows you."* | The eight moves from bow — bow pair sets the feel |
| Good timing at 16 spm, falls apart at 18 | *"Stay together as we bring it up. Don't chase rate."* | Rate increase before timing is solid — ease back |

### New Drill: Cut-the-Cake
- From finish → arms away + body over → **return to finish** → THEN take a full stroke
- They touch body-over position TWICE before each stroke
- Emphasizes the position and builds timing awareness
- *"Feel that position twice. That's where you live."*

### New Drill: Feet-Out Rowing
- Remove feet from shoes (rest on top)
- If they break their knees early, their feet come off the stretcher — instant feedback
- Start with arms + body only (safe), then half slide
- *"If your feet come off, your legs are breaking too early. Let that teach you."*

## Week 3 — "Clean Blades" (Mar 3–7)

### The One Thing
**Clean catch entries, clean finish extractions.** Body-over and timing are now maintenance — correct if they slip but your eyes are on the BLADES.

### What Carries Forward
- Body-over discipline (correct on sight)
- Crew timing (should be improving — still call it but it's not the primary focus)

### Daily Focus

| Day | Activity | Watch For | Key Cue |
|-----|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Mon** | On-water: catch focus, quarter-slide drill | Blade entry — quick, no hesitation, no sky | *"Quick catch, immediate connection"* |
| **Tue** | Erg: reverse pick drill, 20-min piece | Catch connection on erg, rate builds | *"Arrive and drive. The catch is a PLACE, not a rest stop."* |
| **Wed** | Land training + erg | Feet-out (body-over maint.), synced rowing (timing maint.) | *"Keep it clean even when you're working"* |
| **Thu** | On-water: square blade, finish work | Hand height on recovery, clean extraction | *"Carry the blade level. Finish the stroke, THEN release."* |
| **Fri** | Erg challenges | Consistency, feet-out endurance | *"Three weeks of technique. You're rowing."* |

### Common Faults This Week & How to Fix

| What You'll See | What to Say | What's Actually Wrong |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Blade goes too high before catch ("skying") | *"Carry your hands level into the catch. Don't lift."* | Hands dropping on recovery → blade rises |
| Hesitation at the catch (blade hovers) | *"Don't wait at the front. Arrive and drive."* | Fear of catching wrong — just needs reps |
| "Washing out" — blade comes out before stroke finishes | *"Finish the pull, THEN tap down and release"* | Cutting the stroke short — bailing out early |
| Blade too deep during the drive | *"Don't climb up. Drive back, not up."* | Body rising at catch or pulling handle down |

### New Drill: Square Blade Rowing
- Row without feathering — blade stays vertical on recovery
- Reveals hand height issues, catch timing problems, and finish errors
- Start with arms + body only, then half slide, then full (if stable)
- Short bursts: 10 strokes square, 10 normal, repeat
- *"If the blade touches water on recovery, your hands are too low."*

## Week 4 — "Sharpen & Test" (Mar 9–13)

### The One Thing
**Blade work stays sharp as we add power and start seat racing.** Technique doesn't go away just because we're testing fitness.

### What Carries Forward
- Everything: body-over, timing, blade work — all three are now expected
- This week, you're watching for what BREAKS when pressure/effort increases

### Daily Focus

| Day | Activity | Watch For | Key Cue |
|-----|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Mon** | On-water: blade refinement, first 15-min piece | Blade work holding during longer rowing | *"Clean in, clean out"* |
| **Tue** | Erg: 4×500m benchmark | Pacing + does technique hold under effort? | *"Technique STAYS. Even when it hurts."* |
| **Wed** | Land training + recovery row | Quality at easy pace (no sloppiness) | *"Easy doesn't mean sloppy. Keep it clean."* |
| **Thu** | On-water: seat racing | Who rows well WITH others? Who has clean blades? | *"Who makes the boat go?"* |
| **Fri** | Erg: intervals | Does technique hold in 1-min ON intervals? | *"Power WITH technique. Not instead of."* |

### What to Watch During Seat Racing
- **Don't just watch speed.** Watch WHO rows cleanly under pressure.
- Note: Which rower makes the boat feel steadier? Whose timing matches the crew?
- The fastest erg kid might not be the best in the boat if their blade work is sloppy.
- Report observations to the head coach after practice.
