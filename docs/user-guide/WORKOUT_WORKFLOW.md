# Workout Workflow Guide: From Plan to Insight

Master the complete workflow from planning your training to analyzing your performance.

## The Complete Workflow: Overview

Logbook Companion transforms the traditional "log and forget" approach into a continuous improvement cycle:

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                             │
    │  PLAN → EXECUTE → ANALYZE → INSIGHT → PLAN │
    │                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**At each stage, you get value:**

| Stage | What You Do | What You Get |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **PLAN** | Browse templates, select workout | Proven workouts, structured training |
| **EXECUTE** | Row the workout, sync data | Zero manual entry, automatic matching |
| **ANALYZE** | View metrics, compare history | Detailed performance data, trends |
| **INSIGHT** | Understand progress | "Am I getting faster? Where should I focus?" |

## A Day in the Life: Complete Example

Let me show you how this works in practice with a real scenario:

### Monday Morning: Coach Posts Workout

**Coach writes on the whiteboard:**
```
[w]10:00 + 8x500m@2k+10/1:30r + [c]5:00
```

**Athlete (you) copies this to your phone notes.**

### Monday Afternoon: Training Session

**On the erg:**
1. You program your PM5 with the workout structure:
   - Warmup: 10:00
   - Intervals: 8 × 500m, 1:30 rest
   - Cooldown: 5:00

2. You row the workout
   - PM5 records everything: splits, watts, rate, HR
   - You finish feeling strong

3. PM5 automatically syncs to Concept2 Logbook
   - Happens in the background
   - No action needed from you

### Monday Evening: The Magic Happens

**You open Logbook Companion on your phone:**

1. **Automatic sync runs**
   - Pulls your workout from C2 Logbook
   - Reads the interval structure: "8 intervals × 500m, 1:30 rest"
   - Converts to canonical RWN: `8x500m/1:30r`

2. **Template matching**
   - Searches your templates for `8x500m/1:30r`
   - Finds: "Monday 500s" (you've done this workout before)
   - Links them automatically

3. **You see:**
   ```
   New Workout: 8x500m/1:30r
   Linked to: Monday 500s ✅
   Average: 392W (🏆 New PR! +5W from last time)
   ```

4. **You click to view details:**
   - See all 8 splits with watts, pace, rate
   - Chart showing consistent power across intervals
   - Comparison to last month: "You're 5W stronger!"

5. **You check the template page:**
   - See all 12 times you've done this workout
   - Trend chart shows steady improvement
   - PR history: 387W → 390W → 392W

### Tuesday Morning: Coach Reviews

**Coach opens team dashboard:**
- Sees all athletes who completed Monday 500s
- Compares performances
- Notes: "You set a PR, nice work!"

### The Result

**Total time you spent logging:** 0 seconds  
**Total insights gained:** 
- New PR
- Improvement trend
- Pacing consistency
- Comparison to previous attempts

**That's the workflow.** Plan → Execute → Analyze → Insight → Repeat.

Let's walk through each stage in detail.

## Planning Phase: Start with a Proven Workout

### Why Use Templates for Planning?

**The old way:**
- Make up workouts on the fly
- Inconsistent training structure
- Hard to track if specific workouts are working

**The template way:**
- Browse proven workouts (yours + community)
- See what others are doing
- Build consistent training patterns
- Track effectiveness over time

### Browsing the Template Library

**Where to find it:** Main navigation → **Template Library**

**What you'll see:**
- **Your Templates**: Workouts you've created or favorited
- **Community Templates**: Popular workouts shared by others
- **Filters**: By type, distance, duration, difficulty

**Sorting options:**
- Most popular (by usage count)
- Recently added
- Your most-used
- Alphabetical

**Example workflow:**
1. Open Template Library
2. Search for "500m" to find interval workouts
3. See "8x500m/1:00r" with 1,247 uses (popular!)
4. Click to preview the template
5. See example performances and average stats
6. Click "Add to My Templates" or "Favorite"

### Creating or Selecting a Template

**Three scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Using an existing template**
- Browse library
- Find the workout you want
- Add to your templates
- Done! Ready to row

**Scenario 2: Creating from scratch**
- Click "Create New Template"
- Enter RWN: `8x500m/1:00r`
- Add name: "Friday 500s"
- Save
- Now it's in your library

**Scenario 3: Creating from past workout**
- Open any workout in your logbook
- Click "Create Template from This"
- System auto-fills RWN
- Adjust if needed, save
- Future similar workouts auto-link

### Understanding Workout Structure (RWN Breakdown)

Before you row, understand what you're about to do:

**Example:** `[w]10:00 + 8x500m@2k+5/1:00r + [c]5:00`

**Breaking it down:**
- `[w]10:00` = 10 minute warmup
- `+` = followed by (no extra rest)
- `8x500m` = 8 intervals of 500 meters
- `@2k+5` = at 5 seconds slower than your 2k PR pace
- `/1:00r` = with 1 minute rest between intervals
- `+` = followed by
- `[c]5:00` = 5 minute cooldown

**Total time estimate:** ~45 minutes (10 + 8×2 + 7×1 + 5)

**Pro tip:** The template detail page shows:
- Estimated duration
- Total distance
- Work vs. rest breakdown
- Guidance targets (if specified)

## Execution Phase: The Easiest Part

This is where Logbook Companion shines - **minimal manual work**.

### Syncing from Concept2 Logbook (Recommended)

**Why this is the best method:**
- ✅ Zero manual data entry
- ✅ Complete interval data (splits, watts, rate, HR)
- ✅ Automatic template matching
- ✅ Instant analytics

**Setup (one-time):**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Concept2 Integration**
2. Click **"Connect to Concept2"**
3. Log in with your Concept2 account
4. Authorize the connection
5. Done! Now you can sync anytime

**Syncing workouts:**
1. Row your workout on the erg (PM5 records it)
2. Workout appears in Concept2 Logbook (automatic)
3. Open Logbook Companion
4. Click **"Sync Workouts"** (or it syncs automatically)
5. New workouts appear in your logbook
6. System automatically matches to templates

**What gets synced:**
- Workout date and time
- Total distance, time, calories
- Interval structure (if you programmed intervals)
- Split data for each interval
- Average and max: watts, pace, rate, heart rate
- Stroke data (if available)

**Sync frequency:**
- Manual: Click "Sync" anytime
- Automatic: Every time you open the app (if enabled)
- Background: Can be configured for periodic sync

### Manual Entry with RWN (For Non-Concept2 Workouts)

**When to use this:**
- On-water rowing
- Non-Concept2 ergs
- Workouts without automatic logging
- Quick entry for planned future workouts

**How to enter:**
1. Click **"Add Workout"** → **"Manual Entry"**
2. Enter the RWN: `8x500m/1:00r`
3. Add performance data (optional):

- Consistency: Better (less fade in final intervals)
```

**Insights you gain:**
- "I'm getting stronger" (higher watts)
- "My pacing is more consistent" (less variance)
- "I need to work on the last 3 intervals" (fade pattern)

### Personal Bests (Automatic Tracking)

**No manual work required** - the system tracks your PRs automatically.

**Where to see PRs:**

**1. On the template detail page:**
```
Personal Best: 392W avg
Set on: March 1, 2026
View workout →
```

**2. On the dashboard:**
- "Recent PRs" widget
- Shows PRs set in the last 30 days

**3. On individual workouts:**
- "🏆 New PR!" badge if you beat your best

**What counts as a PR:**
- Highest average watts on this template
- Ties go to most recent

**Why it matters:**
- Instant feedback: "Did I beat my best?"
- Motivation: See your progress
- Training validation: "Is this workout making me faster?"

### Zone Analysis

**What it shows:** How much time you spent in each training zone.

**Based on your baseline watts:**
- UT2: <60% of max watts
- UT1: 60-75%
- AT: 75-85%
- TR: 85-95%
- AN: >95%

**Example:**
```
Workout: 3x20:00@UT2/2:00r
Zone Distribution:
- UT2: 58 min (97%) ✅ Target zone
- UT1: 2 min (3%)
- Other: 0 min

Verdict: Good UT2 work, stayed in target zone
```

**Why it matters:**
- Verify you're training in the right zones
- Ensure zone discipline (not going too hard on easy days)
- Track zone distribution over time

### Progress Tracking (Trend Lines, Volume Charts)

**Trend charts show:**
- Performance over time (are you improving?)
- Volume over time (are you training consistently?)
- Zone distribution over time (are you balancing training?)

**Example trend chart:**
```
