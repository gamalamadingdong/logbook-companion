# Project Brief

## Core Mission
Build a local web application that enables users to:
1.  **Analyze**: visualize and gain insights from their Concept2 Logbook data.
2.  **Archive**: Sync their logbook history to a generic Google Sheet for flexibility and backup.

## Non-Negotiable Requirements
-   Must authenticate with Concept2 Logbook API via OAuth2.
-   Must visualize key workout metrics (trends, bests).
-   Must allow syncing data to a Google Sheet.
-   Must be a local web app (Vite/React).

## Target User
-   **Primary**: The user (myself), a rower/athlete who wants deeper insights than the default logbook provides and wants meaningful ownership of their data in a Spreadsheet.
-   **Technical Level**: Comfortable with running local web servers, obtaining API keys.
