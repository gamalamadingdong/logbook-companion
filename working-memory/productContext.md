# Product Context

## Problem
The default Concept2 Logbook is great for logging, but visualizing long-term trends and exporting data for custom analysis is limited or requires manual CSV steps.

## Solution
A unified dashboard that:
1.  Auto-fetches new workouts.
2.  Provides beautiful, instant visualization of progress.
3.  Acts as a bridge to push data into Google Sheets for ultimate flexibility.

## User Experience
-   **Fast**: minimal loading times.
-   **Visual**: Charts and graphs are the primary interface.
-   **Set & Forget**: Once configured, the sync should be easy to trigger.
